"""Regenerate LZF crosscheck fixtures from h5py's built-in LZF filter, and
verify that h5py can read what hdf5-pure writes.

Phase 1 (write) produces a `manifest.json` plus, per fixture:
  <name>.raw.bin          raw uncompressed values (little-endian native width)
  <name>.compressed.bin   stored chunk bytes, only for single-chunk cases
                          whose pipeline is exactly [lzf] — the only streams
                          src/lzf_crosscheck.rs compares at the codec level
                          (raw bytes when h5py skipped the optional filter —
                          see `filter_mask` in the manifest)
  <name>.h5               the h5py-written file, read end-to-end by
                          tests/lzf_roundtrip.rs and handy for h5dump

Phase 2 (read back) points h5py at `pure_written.h5`, the committed file
*hdf5-pure* wrote, and checks h5py decodes every dataset and can write an
incompressible chunk back into it. This is the only check of the write
direction that a real reference implementation performs: the Rust suite
compares our filter pipeline against this manifest, but it has no h5py, and
our LZF stream is deliberately not byte-compared against liblzf's (any
conforming stream is valid). Run it whenever `src/lzf.rs` or the LZF branch of
`ChunkOptions::build_pipeline` changes. `pure_written.h5` is kept in step with
the writer by `pure_written_fixture_is_current` in tests/lzf_roundtrip.rs.

LZF ships with h5py itself (no hdf5plugin needed). h5py registers it as an
*optional* filter: when liblzf cannot shrink a chunk the chunk is stored raw
with its filter-mask bit set — the `u8_noise` case captures that path, which
hdf5-pure's writer never takes (it stores the grown stream instead). hdf5-pure
does record the same optional flag, which is what lets the phase-2 write-back
below succeed.

Run from the repo root with uv (resolves the pins above automatically):
    uv run tests/fixtures/lzf/regen.py

Or in a venv pinned from the sibling requirements file:
    python -m venv tests/fixtures/lzf/.venv
    tests/fixtures/lzf/.venv/bin/pip install -r tests/fixtures/lzf/requirements.txt
    tests/fixtures/lzf/.venv/bin/python tests/fixtures/lzf/regen.py

Pass --verify-only to run phase 2 alone and leave the fixtures untouched.
