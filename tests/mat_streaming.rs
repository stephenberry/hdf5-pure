//! Streaming a MAT v7.3 file: `MatBuilder::finish_to` and the producer-backed
//! `write_blocks`.
//!
//! Two properties carry this feature, and every test here is one of them:
//!
//! - **Byte-identity.** A streamed file equals the buffered one, and a
//!   producer-backed dataset equals the materialized one. Without that, choosing
//!   the low-memory API silently changes the file and no known-good fixture
//!   applies to it.
//! - **Nothing is fully resident.** The producer is called during emission, once
//!   per block, into a buffer it shares with every other call. A refactor that
//!   reintroduced buffering would leave every correctness test green.
