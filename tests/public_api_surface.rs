//! The types a caller reaches by value through the public API can also be
//! named.
//!
//! Every module in this crate is `pub(crate)`, so a type is public API only if
//! `lib.rs` re-exports it — but reading a `pub` field and calling an inherent
//! method need no name, so a type can be reachable and unwritable at once.
//! `File::superblock` hands back a [`Superblock`] and with it a
//! [`BaseAddress`], and `Error::MissingMessage` carries a [`MessageType`].
//!
//! This file is a separate crate, exactly like a consumer, which is what makes
//! it the gate for two things. A re-export dropped from `lib.rs` stops it
//! compiling. So does a *retyped* field of `Superblock`, which nothing else
//! catches: `cargo-semver-checks` ships no lint for one (`struct_pub_field_missing`
//! covers removal and rename), and it could not see these types anyway, since
//! its lints match items by importable path. That combination is how
//! `Superblock::base_address` changed from `u64` to `BaseAddress` in 0.40.0
//! with no finding and no changelog line, leaving callers a value they could
//! compare and print but not use as a number.
//!
//! `scripts/check-api-surface.sh` audits the whole surface for the same class.
