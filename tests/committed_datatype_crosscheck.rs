#![cfg(not(target_pointer_width = "32"))]
//! Committed (`H5Tcommit`) datatypes, written by the reference C library and read
//! back by hdf5-pure (issue #254).
//!
//! A committed datatype is stored in its own object header, and every object that
//! uses it stores a *reference* to that header in place of the type. Nothing in
//! the referring bytes says so — a version 2 reference to address `0x320` decodes
//! as a perfectly well-formed zero-width time datatype — so the only thing that
//! separates a reference from an encoding is a flag bit, and reading the bytes
//! without it returns the wrong type with no error anywhere.
//!
//! The read-side fixtures here are built through the C library's own
//! `H5Tcommit2`, so the type each object *should* report is the one the C library
//! reads back from the same file. The write side runs the other way: this crate
//! places the committed object and the C library is asked whether the type it
//! finds is committed, which is the question no pure-Rust round trip can answer
//! about itself.
