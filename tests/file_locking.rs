//! OS advisory file-locking behavior for the in-place editor (issue #73). Uses
//! only hdf5-pure (no reference C library), so it runs on every target.
//!
//! Only `EditSession` takes a lock (exclusive); `SwmrWriter` and the readers take
//! none. Assertions here are written to hold on both Unix (advisory `flock`) and
//! Windows (mandatory `LockFileEx`): in particular we never read a file while an
//! editor still holds its lock, because that read is permitted on Unix but
//! blocked by the OS on Windows.
