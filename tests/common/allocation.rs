//! Measuring what one piece of work allocates, from inside a test binary.
//!
//! Included with `#[path = "common/allocation.rs"] mod allocation;` rather than
//! through `common/mod.rs`, deliberately: that module also declares the
//! reference-C-library helpers, and a binary that names it links a static
//! libhdf5 it has no use for. These helpers are pure Rust and pull in
//! `heapscope` alone.
//!
//! # What the including binary has to declare
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOC: heapscope::Alloc = heapscope::Alloc::system();
//! ```
//!
//! A `#[global_allocator]` is a property of the binary, so it cannot live here.
//! Leaving it out is not a silent miss: [`measure`] refuses to start a profiler
//! that would record nothing, naming the line above.

/// **It is also the way a test built on this goes quietly hollow.** Work that
/// moves to a worker thread stops being measured, and every figure here collapses
/// toward zero while an upper bound on it goes on passing. This is not
/// hypothetical for this crate: the read path has a parallel variant waiting to
/// be written. So a test that asserts a ceiling must assert a floor beside it —
/// the read's own output is in these figures, so its size is a floor that costs
/// one line and cannot be satisfied by a measurement of nothing.
