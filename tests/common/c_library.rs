/// This is the assertion a delete test wants, and `is_err()` is not it: a file
/// so damaged the C library cannot walk the group at all also fails, so
/// `is_err()` passes on the corruption a delete was supposed to avoid. That is
/// the [#201] failure mode — a write path returning `Ok` on a file the C library
/// cannot read.
///
/// `H5E_NOTFOUND` alone is not it either. A damaged link table reports
/// `NotFound` too, because an unreadable index and a missing link are
/// indistinguishable at the traversal layer. Sweeping single-byte through
/// 32-byte corruptions across every metadata offset of a 40-dataset file, 885
/// produced a detectable failure and **176 of those carried `NotFound`**.
///
/// What separates the two is the metadata cache: a genuine absence reads every
/// block it needs and finds no matching link, so it never reports a load or
/// decode failure. Adding that conjunction took the same sweep from 176 false
/// accepts to zero, while still accepting a genuine absence in a compact group,
/// a dense group, a subgroup, a missing group, and a missing attribute.
///
/// `tests/c_absence_predicate.rs` guards that this stays able to tell the two
/// apart; read it before changing either condition.
