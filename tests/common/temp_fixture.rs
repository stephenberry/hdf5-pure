//! Fixture paths that two concurrent runs of the suite cannot collide on
//! (issue #334).
//!
//! Included with `#[path = "common/temp_fixture.rs"] mod temp_fixture;` rather
//! than through `common/mod.rs`, for the reason `common/allocation.rs` gives: a
//! binary that names that module links a static libhdf5 it has no use for. This
//! one is `std` plus `tempfile`.
//!
//! A fixture named directly in the shared system temporary directory resolves to
//! the same path in every process, so two runs of the same test binary at once —
//! two agents, two terminals, a `cargo test` beside a `cargo nextest run` — write
//! over each other's files. The tests then fail in ways that read like real
//! defects: measured before this helper landed, two concurrent runs of
//! `edit_free_space` failed 16 and 19 of their 26 tests, every one of which
//! passes alone. [`temp_path`] gives each call a directory of its own, so a
//! fixture name only has to be unique within its test, and removes that
//! directory when the test ends whether it passed, failed, or panicked.
