//! `SyncPolicy` — who owns the `fsync` cadence, this crate or the application
//! (issue #263).
//!
//! What the policy governs is invisible from here by construction: a skipped
//! barrier writes exactly the bytes an issued one writes, and this crate's tests
//! simulate a crash by copying the file rather than by losing the page cache, so
//! no test in this suite can observe the difference. That the barriers really are
//! skipped is asserted in the library tests, through an image that counts them.
//!
//! These are the other half — that skipping them costs durability and *nothing
//! else*: the same file, the same content, the same refusals.
