// `FileAccessProperties::with_page_buffer_size` holds dirty pages across the
// write engine's ordering barriers, which issues every publish point ahead of
// the content it names — so a session that dies mid-flush can leave a dataset
// that reads *clean* and returns fill values or a deleted object's bytes, with
// every checksum verifying. The mark is what makes that file refuse to open
// instead, here and in the C library alike.
//
// It raises bit 0 alone, where a SWMR writer raises bits 0 and 2, so `flags`
// below distinguishes the two rather than only reporting "marked".
