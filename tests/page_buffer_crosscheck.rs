//! The write-back page buffer against the reference C library (issue #308).
//!
//! Two claims are made for the crash mark a page-buffered session raises, and
//! only the C library can settle either. The first is that a session which dies
//! with dirty pages in memory leaves a file the *whole ecosystem* refuses, not
//! just this crate — the mark is worth its cost only if `H5Fopen` honors it, and
//! `H5F_SUPER_WRITE_ACCESS` alone is a different bit pattern from the SWMR pair
//! whose refusal `owned_swmr_crosscheck` already pins. The second is that a file
//! written *through* the buffer and closed cleanly is an ordinary file again:
//! mark down, paged layout intact, data where the C library looks for it.
