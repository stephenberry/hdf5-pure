//! Shared object header messages (SOHM), written by the reference C library and
//! read back by hdf5-pure (issue #417).
//!
//! A file created with `H5Pset_shared_mesg_index` stores one copy of each message
//! it shares in a fractal heap the superblock extension names, and every object
//! past the first carries an eight-byte heap ID in place of the message. Nothing
//! in the referring bytes says what the message *was*: a heap ID decodes as a
//! perfectly well-formed datatype, dataspace or attribute if a reader mistakes it
//! for content. So the whole file — its attributes, its element types, its shapes
//! and its data — is what these fixtures assert, against the values the C library
//! put there.
//!
//! Two things the reader must not depend on are varied deliberately: whether the
//! index is a **list** or a **version 2 B-tree** (forced by driving the message
//! count past the list maximum), and how many objects share one message.
