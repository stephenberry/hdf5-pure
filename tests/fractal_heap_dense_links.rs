//!
//! Regression for a fractal-heap reader bug: the doubling-table row classifier
//! used the `start_root_rows` header field as the direct/indirect boundary
//! instead of the computed `max_direct_rows`. Once a dense group's heap grew a
//! root indirect block with more direct-block rows than that hint (empirically
//! ~150 short links), rows that are actually direct were mis-read as indirect
//! and the reader recursed into a direct block expecting an indirect-block
//! signature, failing with `InvalidFractalHeapSignature`. These groups are read
//! through both the buffered and the streaming reader.
