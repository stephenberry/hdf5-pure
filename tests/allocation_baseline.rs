//! The exact allocation figures for one write-then-read cycle, recorded rather
//! than chosen (issue #228).
//!
//! `tests/allocation_bounds.rs` states the rules — a windowed read allocates on
//! the order of its window, a chunked read costs a constant per chunk — and those
//! run everywhere. This file is the other half: the numbers themselves, committed
//! under `tests/baselines/` so a change to them arrives in a pull request as a
//! line a reviewer reads rather than as nothing at all. A 5% creep passes every
//! rule in this suite and shows up here.
//!
//! # Why this is behind a feature, one platform, and one feature set
//!
//! An exact allocation count is a property of a target, a toolchain *and* a
//! feature set, not of this crate alone: a `Vec` growth policy, an `OsString` on
//! one platform and a `String` on another, or a new `std` release all move it
//! without anything here changing. The feature set is not hypothetical —
//! `--all-features` measured 416 bytes above the default set on the same machine,
//! in the same commit. So the figures are recorded where they can be checked (see
//! the `heap-baseline` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and the default suite
//! runs the rules instead. Widening this to a second platform is a matter of
//! measuring it there, not of loosening anything.
//!
//! Hence the cfg below, which names the default set from both sides: the three
//! default features must be on and every other one off. That is the set the
//! figures were recorded under and the set a dependent's build most resembles.
//! Under `--all-features` — the pre-push gate — it compiles to nothing rather
//! than failing against numbers from another configuration.
//!
//! **The list is maintained by hand and nothing will tell you when it is stale.**
//! A feature added to the crate and not added here simply widens the set this
//! accepts, silently, because `--all-features` turns on `fast-deflate` and so
//! compiles this out whatever else is added. There is no version of this cfg that
//! self-corrects; adding a feature to the crate means adding it here.
//!
//! # When it fails
//!
//! Read the named figures: some path started allocating more, and the message
//! says which figure and by how much.
//!
//! The comparison is one-sided — heapscope reports only figures that *grew* — so
//! a number that went **down** never fails and never appears. That is worth
//! knowing because it is how the gate goes slack: an improvement leaves the file
//! recording the worse old number, and the difference becomes headroom a later
//! regression can spend for free. Re-record after an improvement too; nothing
//! will remind you.
//!
//! Re-record with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! HEAPSCOPE_UPDATE_BASELINE=1 cargo test --features heap-baseline --test allocation_baseline
//! ```
//!
//! and commit the diff with the change that caused it.
//!
//! # What is measured
//!
//! The whole process, which is why this binary holds exactly one `#[test]`: the
//! profiler is process-wide, and `HeapStats` cannot be built from a
//! `heapscope::Region`'s figures (it is `#[non_exhaustive]`), so a baseline is a
//! reading of the run rather than of a phase inside it. The consequence worth
//! knowing is that the fixture below is part of the measurement: changing what it
//! writes changes the numbers legitimately. The upside is that the write path is
//! pinned here too, and it allocates more than the read does.
