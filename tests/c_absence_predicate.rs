// Crosschecks link the reference HDF5 C library (the `hdf5-metno` dev-dependency),
// gated to 64-bit little-endian targets.
#![cfg(all(not(target_pointer_width = "32"), target_endian = "little"))]
//! Guards the discriminating power of [`common::assert_c_absent`], which the
//! delete crosschecks use to prove a removed object is *absent* rather than
//! merely unreachable.
//!
//! Without this file the helper could silently decay. Its conditions are tuned
//! to which minor error codes the reference C library reports, and a libhdf5
//! upgrade can change that: if a future version stopped reporting a load
//! failure when metadata is damaged, the helper would keep passing while no
//! longer distinguishing damage from absence, and every delete crosscheck would
//! quietly weaken back to `is_err()`.
//!
//! So this asserts both directions, and asserts that the extra conditions are
//! still doing work.
//!
//! Every call goes through the safe `hdf5-metno` API, which serializes its own C
//! calls through an internal lock, so no extra guard is needed.
