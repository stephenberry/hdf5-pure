//! What the read paths are allowed to allocate, as rules rather than as numbers
//! (issue #228).
//!
//! Every bound here is a statement about how the work *scales* — a windowed read
//! allocates on the order of its window, a chunked read allocates a fixed number
//! of blocks per chunk — so it holds on every platform, where an exact count does
//! not. Those are pinned separately, on one platform, in
//! `tests/allocation_baseline.rs`.
//!
//! Scaling is not the same as unbreakable, and the margins differ: the byte and
//! peak bounds have several times' headroom and will not notice a `Vec` growth
//! step anywhere, while `BLOCKS_PER_CHUNK` sits about 3% above a measured
//! 3.00-per-chunk rate on purpose — one more allocation *inside the per-chunk
//! loop* is exactly what it exists to catch, and a growth step there would fail
//! it too. That is the trade it is meant to make.
//!
//! Measurement is per region and per thread (`tests/common/allocation.rs`), so
//! these tests share a process without serializing against each other: what a
//! region records is what the calling thread allocated inside it, and nothing
//! else. That last part is also how a test here could go quiet, which is why each
//! one asserts a floor as well as a ceiling — see [`allocation::Measured`].
