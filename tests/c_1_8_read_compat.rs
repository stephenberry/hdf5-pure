//! Reading files written by an actual HDF5 1.8 library, from committed bytes.
//!
//! This is not the crate's first coverage of these formats, and does not claim
//! to be. `tests/owned_swmr_crosscheck.rs` already asks libhdf5 for a version 1
//! superblock and checks the parsed K values and status flags against it, and
//! `tests/edit_crosscheck.rs` does the same for a version 2 one. What both cost
//! is the `hdf5-metno` dev-dependency, which requires 64-bit pointers — so every
//! file using it opens with `#![cfg(not(target_pointer_width = "32"))]` and
//! compiles out on the i686 target, which is where address arithmetic is most
//! likely to be wrong. Reading committed bytes needs no dev-dependency, so this
//! runs there; it is listed in the `cross test` target list in `ci.yml`.
//!
//! The committed corpus also had nothing at these versions: of the 80 tracked
//! `.h5`/`.mat` fixtures before these two, 69 were superblock 0 and 11 were
//! superblock 3.
//!
//! What the pair uniquely holds is `v2_superblock.h5`: a **version 2 superblock
//! carrying a version 1 B-tree chunk index**. This crate's writer cannot produce
//! that combination — it refuses chunked storage under a 1.8 bound, because the
//! only chunk indices it writes arrived in 1.10 — so no round trip through it
//! can stand in for the file.
//!
//! Both files hold the same objects, written by the same `regen.c`, so a failure
//! in one and not the other names the format rather than the reader. See
//! `tests/fixtures/c_1_8/NOTICE.md`.
