# release.sh — cut a new hdf5-pure release.
#
# Automates the mechanical, easy-to-botch parts of a release so they come out
# identical every time:
#   * bump the version in Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock, or accept one a breaking
#     PR already bumped (see "Versioning" in CLAUDE.md)
#   * promote the CHANGELOG's [Unreleased] section into a dated `## [X.Y.Z]`
#     section and refresh the two compare links at the bottom
#   * verify the crate still packages (`cargo publish --dry-run`)
#   * commit "Release vX.Y.Z" and create the annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag
#
# The one-paragraph editorial summary that leads each release's changelog
# section is yours to write: pass it with --summary / --summary-file, or the
# script inserts a TODO placeholder and reminds you to fill it in before the
# release is published.
#
# Public, irreversible steps are opt-in and never run by default. Without any
# of the flags below the script only touches your working tree and local git,
# then prints the remaining commands:
#   --commit       commit the release and create the tag (implied by the below)
#   --push         push main and the tag to origin      (implies --commit)
#   --gh-release   create the GitHub release from the changelog section
#                                                        (implies --push)
#   --publish      `cargo publish` to crates.io          (implies --commit)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh 0.21.0 --summary-file notes.md
#   scripts/release.sh 0.21.0 --summary "One-paragraph summary." --push --gh-release

# required" and skips every check for the rest of the cycle. `--release-type
# minor` overrides that derivation and forces the full run, which is worth having
# exactly once, here, where the accumulated delta can be read against the
# [Unreleased] section about to be promoted.
#
# Informational: a listed break is expected under a 0.x minor bump, and an empty
# report on a cycle whose changelog claims a breaking change is the real signal.
#
# The feature list is deliberate rather than derived — it names the features
# whose public API is worth checking, not every feature that exists, so the
# test-only ones stay out. That makes it drift when a feature is renamed or
# removed, and `|| true` would then hide cargo's "feature does not exist" error
# behind an empty report that reads exactly like a clean one. Check the names
# against the manifest first, so the drift stops the release and says so.
