# Check this crate's HDF5 1.8 output format against an actual HDF5 1.8 library.
#
# Why this exists, and why it is not a CI job
# -------------------------------------------
# MATLAB linked HDF5 1.8.12 before R2021b — a different, older library than
# the 1.10.7 behind its own `h5read`/`h5disp`/`h5info` family. A version 3
# superblock is a 1.10 addition, so a file carrying one reads fine under
# `h5disp` and fails under `load`. That is the whole reason `mat::Options`
# defaults to `LibVer::V18`.
#
# Nothing in the test suite can catch a regression here. The `hdf5-metno`
# dev-dependency builds a current libhdf5, `h5py` links a current libhdf5, and
# every third-party MAT v7.3 reader (mat73, hdf5storage, pymatreader, MAT.jl,
# matio) delegates to whichever libhdf5 *it* links. All of them read a version 3
# superblock without complaint. The failure is one byte below everything they
# parse, so only an old library can see it.
#
# So this builds HDF5 1.8.23 — the last 1.8 release — and points its tools at
# both formats. It takes a couple of minutes and needs network access the first
# time, which is why it is a script you run rather than a gate that runs itself.
# Run it when changing anything about superblock or message versions.
#
#   ./scripts/check-hdf5-18.sh
#
# Measured on 1.8.23 when the 1.8 output format landed in 0.34.0:
#   superblock 3 (through 0.33.0) -> h5dump: "unable to open file", exit 1
#   superblock 2 (0.34.0 default) -> h5dump reads data, groups and attributes
#   h5repack round trip           -> preserves every attribute (it dropped all
#                                    of them before the Attribute Info fix)
#   committed (H5Tcommit) type    -> listed as a named datatype, and the dataset
#                                    and attribute typed through it both read
#
# And on 1.8.23 when the cell and string-class fixtures were added in 0.35.0:
#   cell of vectors, of structs,  -> 1.8 follows every object reference to its
#   and of a `None`                  `#refs#` target — datasets and groups alike
#                                    — and reads each one's data
#   H5PATH on an interned object  -> reads back as the object's own path, on a
#                                    group as well as a dataset
#   the canonical empty           -> carries no H5PATH, as in MATLAB's own files
#   MATLAB_fields                 -> the vlen string array decodes
#   empty value, `struct([])`     -> the dimension payload reads as `0 0`
#   MCOS subsystem                -> the opaque handle, the templates' reference
#                                    arrays and the alias all read
#
# Those two fixtures are what put object references, a `#refs#` group, a vlen
# attribute and an MCOS subsystem in front of an old library at all; before them
# this was scalars, vectors, a struct, a string and an empty. Nor had 1.8 ever
# read the builder-backed emitter's output: `to_file` goes through the walker,
# and the builder's only other fixture is the 1.10 file, which 1.8 refuses by
# design. `mat_string_v18.mat` is written through the builder for that reason as
# much as for the subsystem.
#
# One thing that measurement showed about this file's shape: 1.8's h5dump gives
# up on the *whole file* when a committed datatype does not decode, so the plain
# checks above fail alongside the committed ones. The committed fixture is what
# makes any of them sensitive to it — before it there was no named type in the
# file to get wrong — and the committed checks say which thing broke rather than
# leaving "the file will not open" to be interpreted. The exception is a type
# that is written and referenced but never linked: the file then reads correctly
# end to end and 1.8 lists the type as `/#324`, its address standing in for the
# name it lost. Only `check_named_type` sees that one.
#
# The checks below compare dataset and attribute *values*, not just exit status.
# A file whose headers all decode while its data resolves to the wrong offset
# opens cleanly and lists every object, so `h5dump -n` alone would report it as
# passing — which is the defect class this format work fixed on the read side.
