# File Property Support (`fapl` / `fcpl` / `dapl`)

HDF5 configures a file through property lists: a **file-creation property list** (`fcpl`, passed to `H5Fcreate`), a **file-access property list** (`fapl`, passed to `H5Fcreate`/`H5Fopen`), and a **dataset-access property list** (`dapl`, passed to `H5Dopen`). `hdf5-pure` does not expose property-list *handles*, but it does model all three as plain reusable values: `FileCreateProperties`, `FileAccessProperties`, and `DatasetAccessProperties`. Build one once and pass it to `FileBuilder::with_create_properties` / `File::create_with_options`, to any `*_with_options` open, or to `File::dataset_with_options`. The equivalent `FileBuilder` methods set the same creation properties one at a time.

## How these types are named

A `*Properties` type stands in for **one whole HDF5 property list**, so every setting on it is looked up on this page — including the few that have no C counterpart at all (`with_memory_strategy`, `with_sync_policy`), which the tables mark as such. Three types carry that suffix: `FileCreateProperties` (`fcpl`), `FileAccessProperties` (`fapl`), and `DatasetAccessProperties` (`dapl`). Where a setting belongs to a *different* HDF5 class than the table it appears in, that table labels it with its real class in parentheses.

"Stands in for" is not "covers": each of the three models a **subset** of its list's properties, and the tables below give the whole picture by listing what is unsupported as well as what works.

The suffix is a positive claim only. A `*Options` or `*Config` type makes **no** claim either way, and some of them do map to C properties: `ChunkCacheConfig` carries the `rdcc_*` values that both `H5Pset_cache` (an `fapl` property) and `H5Pset_chunk_cache` (a `dapl` property) take, so it belongs to no single list; `MetadataCacheConfig` is the analogue of the `H5AC_cache_config_t` *struct* that one `fapl` property accepts, not of a list; and `RepackOptions`, `VlenStringReadOptions`, and `mat::Options` have no HDF5 counterpart at all.

The `*_with_options` constructors keep their names. That suffix marks the explicit-configuration variant of an open, in the ordinary Rust sense of [`OpenOptions`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.OpenOptions.html); it does not name a type, and the type is visible in the signature.

This page is the consolidated map from each HDF5 property to what the crate supports. For the file-space details behind the first table, see [File-Space Strategy](../guide/file-space.md); for the read-write access modes, see [Editing in Place](../guide/editing.md) and [Streaming Large Files](../guide/streaming.md).

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Genuine** | The property changes the on-disk result exactly as HDF5 specifies, verified against the reference C library. |
| **Recorded** | The value is written to the file and round-trips through the C library, but does not change the layout — correct for a fresh file, which has no free space to manage yet. |
| **Read-only** | Honored when reading a file; no write-side effect. |
| **Behavioral** | Changes how the crate operates on the file — memory, durability — without changing a byte of the result. There is nothing on disk to verify against the C library. |
| **Assertion** | Validated on write, but cannot change the emitted format. |
| **Unsupported** | No equivalent; the property is absent, or a file requiring it is refused up front. |
| **N/A** | Not meaningful for the on-disk format this crate emits. |

## File-creation properties (`fcpl`)

Set through [`FileBuilder`](../guide/writing.md) before `write` / `finish`, individually or all at once with `FileBuilder::with_create_properties(FileCreateProperties)`. `File::create_with_options(path, fcpl, fapl)` applies them on the owned-handle path, mirroring `H5Fcreate(name, flags, fcpl_id, fapl_id)`. Because it returns an open read-write handle, a creation/access pair the reopen would refuse — a paged file with `persist = false`, or a userblock under `MemoryStrategy::Bounded` — fails before anything is written.

| HDF5 property (C API) | `hdf5-pure` | Status | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `H5Pset_file_space_strategy(PAGE, …)` | `with_file_space_strategy(FileSpaceStrategy::Page, …)` | **Genuine** | Real page-aligned allocation: metadata and raw data occupy separate pages, and each page's free tail is tracked in a per-page-type `FSHD`/`FSSE` manager. The C library reads it as paged and `H5Fget_freespace` matches the tracked total. |
| `H5Pset_file_space_strategy(FSM_AGGR / AGGR / NONE, …)` | `…(FsmAggr / Aggr / None, …)` | **Recorded** | Strategy stored in the superblock extension; the layout stays sequential. Freed regions become tracked once a read-write session deletes an object. |
| `persist` flag | 2nd argument of `with_file_space_strategy` | **Genuine** (paged) / **Recorded** (non-paged) | Paged: per-page-type managers are written from creation. Non-paged: records intent; managers appear after a later delete. |
| `threshold` | 3rd argument of `with_file_space_strategy` | **Recorded (advisory)** | Round-trips through the C library, but the crate currently tracks every page tail / freed section regardless of it. |
| `H5Pset_file_space_page_size` | `with_file_space_page_size` | **Genuine** (paged) / **Recorded** (non-paged) | Under `Page` it is the alignment quantum (default 4096; must be a power of two `>= 512`). Under other strategies it is recorded but inert. |
| `H5Pset_userblock` | `with_userblock` | **Genuine** | Reserves a zero-filled prefix; all addresses are base-relative. The HDF5 "zero, or a power of two `>= 512`" rule is validated at write time (`FormatError::InvalidUserblockSize`), since the size *is* the superblock's base address and readers scan only the doubling sequence for the signature. Under `Page` the userblock must additionally be a whole number of pages. Contents come from `FileBuilder::with_userblock_content`, which every output path emits. |
| `H5Pset_libver_bounds` (fapl) | `with_libver_bounds` | **Assertion** | The writer always emits the v3 (HDF5 1.10) superblock; the bound is an accept/reject check, not a format selector. HDF5 classes this as a *file-access* property; it sits on `FileCreateProperties` because this crate checks the bound at write time. |
| `H5Pset_fill_value` / `H5Pset_fill_time` (dcpl) | `DatasetBuilder::with_fill_value` | **Genuine** (per dataset) | Encodes the fill value in a v3 Fill Value message; `Dataset::fill_value` reads it back, from this crate's files and the C library's. |
| `H5Pset_obj_track_times` (ocpl) | none | **Unsupported** | Objects are always written with times untracked (equivalent to `false`); there is no way to enable tracking. |
| `H5Pset_sym_k` / `H5Pset_istore_k` | none | **N/A** | The v3 superblock omits these fields; groups are always new-style (link messages + v2 object headers). |
| `H5Pset_link_phase_change` / `H5Pset_est_link_info` (gcpl) | none | **Unsupported** | Group Info is written minimal, so the C library's defaults (max-compact 8, min-dense 6) apply; the thresholds are not tunable. |

## File-access properties (`fapl`)

Selected through the `File` open-mode constructor, with memory budgets and locking set through `FileAccessProperties` / `DatasetAccessProperties` / `FileLocking`.

| HDF5 property / driver | `hdf5-pure` | Status | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `H5Fopen(RDONLY)`, default sec2 | `File::open` | **Genuine (read-only)** | Whole-file buffered read; takes no lock. |
| positioned / on-demand reads | `File::open_streaming` | **Genuine (read-only, bounded)** | Fetches metadata and chunks on demand; peak memory near one chunk. |
| user-supplied read driver (cf. `H5Pset_driver`) | `File::from_source` / `from_source_with_options`, over the `Source` trait | **Genuine (read-only, bounded)** | The same on-demand reads over bytes that are not a path — an object store addressed by range request, a sandboxed guest handed byte ranges by its host. Reads that come back short are refused rather than parsed. |
| `H5Pset_fapl_core` / `H5Pset_file_image` | `File::from_bytes` / `FileBuilder::finish` | **Genuine** | Read an in-memory file image, or build one into a `Vec<u8>`. |
| `H5Fopen(RDWR)` | `File::open_rw` / `open_rw_with_options` | **Genuine (read-write)** | Reads, appends, and staged edits + `commit`. Holds a latest-format file with no userblock in bounded memory and anything else in a whole-file mirror, picked from the file. Commits to a paged file through a page-aware tail; a paged file without persisted free space is refused at open. |
| `H5Fopen(RDWR)`, bounded memory | `File::open_rw_with_options` + `MemoryStrategy::Bounded` | **Genuine (read-write, bounded)** | `File::open_rw` picks the bounded backing itself; stating `Bounded` makes it strict, refusing a file the bounded engine cannot edit instead of mirroring it. |
| no C counterpart | `FileAccessProperties::with_memory_strategy`, `MemoryStrategy` | **Behavioral** | How much memory a read-write open may spend holding the file, overriding the dispatch above. `Bounded` refuses a file the bounded engine cannot edit — a pre-v2 superblock or a userblock — rather than mirroring it; `Auto` (what `open_rw` uses unset) falls back to the mirror instead; `Mirrored` always mirrors. A paged file without persisted free space is refused under both preferences, because the mirror cannot commit it either. `File::edit_backing` reports which backend an open resolved to, as an `EditBacking` (`Bounded` or `Mirrored`) — a separate type because `Auto` is a preference between the two and never an outcome. The C library has no analogue: `H5Fopen` picks its own caching with no caller-visible memory contract. |
| `H5F_ACC_SWMR_READ` / `H5F_ACC_SWMR_WRITE` | `File::open_swmr` / `open_swmr_writer` (`*_with_options`) | **Genuine** | No OS lock; the writer raises the superblock SWMR-write flag (v3 superblock required, as in the C library) and appends only. The writer always mirrors, so it accepts `MemoryStrategy::Auto` and `Mirrored` and refuses an explicit `Bounded`. |
| superblock status flags (`h5clear -s`) | checked by `File::open`, `open_streaming`, `from_source`, `open_rw`, `open_swmr`, `open_swmr_writer`; cleared by `File::clear_swmr_flag` | **Genuine** | A file the byte marks as held by a writer is refused with `Error::FileMarkedInUse`, as `H5Fopen` refuses it; `File::open_swmr` follows it instead, refusing only a half-set mark. Version-3 superblocks only, which is where the C library checks. `File::from_bytes` does not consult the byte (and neither, therefore, does `mat::from_file`), so a caller holding the bytes can still read a flagged file — which is the only way through for a `File::from_source` caller, since clearing the flag in place needs a path. |
| `H5Pset_file_locking` + `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING` | `FileAccessProperties::with_locking`, `FileLocking` | **Genuine** | Exclusive advisory lock on both read-write paths, mirror and bounded (non-blocking → `Error::FileLocked`); the env var override recognizes the same values as the C library. Readers and the SWMR writer take no lock by design and ignore the setting. |
| `H5Fget_libver_bounds` (read) | `File::libver_bound` | **Read-only** | Reports the low library-version bound the superblock version implies. |
| `H5Pset_cache` (rdcc) / `H5Pset_chunk_cache` (dapl) | `FileAccessProperties::with_chunk_cache`, `DatasetAccessProperties::with_chunk_cache` | **Genuine (all backends)** | A decompressed-chunk + parsed-index cache (default 1 MiB / 16 slots). `rdcc_nslots` and `rdcc_nbytes` map directly; no write coalescing (a mutation clears it) and no `rdcc_w0`, for the reason below. `Dataset::chunk_cache_stats` reports what it did. |
| `H5Pset_mdc_config` | `FileAccessProperties::with_metadata_cache`, `MetadataCacheConfig` | **Behavioral (partial)** | A byte budget for a metadata-read LRU on the streaming and bounded backends; default off. `File::metadata_cache_stats` reports what it did (`H5Fget_mdc_hit_rate` + `H5Fget_mdc_size`) and `File::reset_metadata_cache_stats` clears the counters (`H5Freset_mdc_hit_rate_stats`). Of `H5AC_cache_config_t` this is `max_size`; see [below](#the-metadata-cache-h5pset_mdc_config) for what the other 29 fields would mean here. |
| no C counterpart | `FileAccessProperties::with_sync_policy`, `SyncPolicy`, `File::sync` | **Behavioral** | Who issues the `fsync`s. The default `Always` forces durability at every point the write paths define one; `OnClose` issues none during the session — the cadence is the application's, through `File::sync` — and one at `close` or drop, which write past the point any caller could order them. Writes still reach the operating system by the time the operation making them returns either way — unless `with_page_buffer_size` (off by default, and it requires `OnClose`) is set — so what moves to the caller is power-loss durability within the session, not same-machine visibility — see [Choosing the fsync cadence](../guide/editing.md#choosing-the-fsync-cadence) for the cost in full. The C library has no property for this because it never `fsync`s at all: the default `sec2` driver installs no flush callback, so `H5Fflush` drains libhdf5's caches with `write` and stops. |
| `H5Pset_page_buffer_size` | `FileAccessProperties::with_page_buffer_size` | **Genuine** | A write-back page buffer for a read-write session: dirty pages live across the ordering barriers inside a commit or append, up to the byte budget, then flush whole. Requires a budget of at least both the page it merges within (the file's own when `Page`, else the format's 4 KiB default) and the 1 MiB a session already gathers under, a version-3 superblock, `SyncPolicy::OnClose`, and — on a `Page` file only — persisted free space. All are refused rather than ignored, as are the SWMR writer and any `File::create_with_options` pair that could not be reopened. It does **not** require a `Page` file, where `H5PB_create` does: the C page buffer is a page cache whose per-kind reservations count pages the paged allocator segregates, while this is a write gatherer that needs only a window to merge within. The 1 MiB floor has no C counterpart either, because `H5PB_write` bypasses the C buffer for any I/O of a page or more; nothing bypasses this one, so a smaller budget is also where a long run is flushed and restarted (one 4 MiB append: 10 writes at 1 MiB, 1,094 at 4 KiB). A sub-page budget is refused rather than silently rounded up as `H5Fopen` does. It reorders publish points ahead of the content they name, so the session raises superblock status-flag bit 0 (`H5F_SUPER_WRITE_ACCESS`) for its lifetime: a writer that dies mid-flush leaves a file this crate, `H5Fopen` and h5py all refuse, rather than one that reads clean and returns fill values or a deleted object's bytes. The C library's page buffer reorders the same way and ships no such mark. Only the budget is modeled, not `min_meta_perc` / `min_raw_perc`: the buffer does not evict, so it has no victim to choose. Off by default, which still leaves the write gathering every read-write session does. |
| `H5Pset_fapl_family` / `split` / `multi` / `mpio` / `direct` / `ros3` / `log` | none | **Unsupported** | Only two implicit drivers exist: an in-memory buffer and `Read + Seek` positioned I/O. A multi-file, parallel, or remote-object file is not opened. |

### The metadata cache (`H5Pset_mdc_config`)

`H5AC_cache_config_t` is 30 fields (version 1, checked against HDF5 2.1.0). `MetadataCacheConfig` models one of them, `max_size`, as `max_bytes`, plus a `max_entry_bytes` cap that has no C counterpart. That ratio invites the reading that 29 things are missing, so here is what each group would mean for a cache that holds **byte ranges of a file being read**, rather than parsed entries of a file being written:

| Group | Fields | Applies here? |
|---|---|---|
| `max_size` | 1 | **Modeled**, as `MetadataCacheConfig::max_bytes`. |
| Adaptive resize: `min_size`, `epoch_length`, `incr_mode` + 4, `flash_incr_mode` + 2, `decr_mode` + 7 | 18 | Not modeled, and one feature rather than 18 knobs. See below. |
| Dirty-data and parallel: `min_clean_fraction`, `dirty_bytes_threshold`, `metadata_write_strategy` | 3 | **Never.** This cache holds only bytes read; there is no dirty entry to keep clean, flush, or write. A read-write session drops the ranges its writes overlap rather than flushing them, which `MetadataCacheStats::invalidations` counts. |
| Diagnostics: `version`, `rpt_fcn_enabled`, `open_trace_file`, `close_trace_file`, `trace_file_name` | 5 | No. `version` is C ABI evolution, and the rest are a trace-file facility this crate has no counterpart to. What they were for is answered by `File::metadata_cache_stats`. |
| Initial sizing: `set_initial_size`, `initial_size` | 2 | No effect to have. There is no preallocated arena: entries are allocated as reads admit them, so the initial size *is* zero and the maximum is the only bound. |
| `evictions_enabled` | 1 | Expressible already, as a budget larger than the metadata a session reads. A separate flag would be a second way to say it, and one that silently uncaps memory. |

**Adaptive resize is the one substantive gap, and leaving it out is deliberate.** The algorithm grows the cache when an epoch's hit rate falls below `lower_hr_threshold` and shrinks it when the rate rises above `upper_hr_threshold` or entries age out, so that a caller does not have to pick a size. Picking one is cheap here: since [#367](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/367) the store is indexed rather than scanned, so a hit costs about the same at 65,000 entries as at 1,000 (161 ns against 136 ns, measured), and an over-generous budget costs memory and nothing else. The advice the algorithm would arrive at — set it generously — is one line, and `File::metadata_cache_stats` is what confirms it landed. Note also the direction it runs in: a low hit rate makes it hold *more*. Before #367 that was the wrong direction on this store, which is why the two issues were taken in that order.


### The chunk cache (`rdcc`)

`ChunkCacheConfig` models `rdcc_nslots` and `rdcc_nbytes` directly. The third field, `rdcc_w0`, is not modeled, and the reason is what it discriminates rather than a gap in the eviction code.

In `H5Dchunk.c`, `w0` is a **head start measured in entries**: `w[0] = (int)(rdcc->nused * rdcc->w0)`, counted down one per step of `H5D__chunk_cache_prune`. Two methods walk the LRU list from its least-recently-used end. Method 0 preempts only entries that are *not* partially consumed; method 1 preempts anything unlocked, and is not introduced until the head start reaches zero. So `w0` sets how far the selective rule gets to run alone, and its discriminator is `H5D_rdcc_ent_t::rd_count` / `wr_count` — per-entry "bytes remaining" counts initialised to the chunk size and decremented by `naccessed` in `H5D__chunk_unlock`. `w0` answers exactly one question: **prefer to drop a chunk the caller consumed in full over one it consumed in part.**

Nothing here answers to that question, for two separate reasons.

| C field | Applies here? |
|---|---|
| `wr_count` | **Never.** This cache holds decompressed data read from the file. There is no dirty chunk to write back; a commit in the session drops what it may have made stale, which `ChunkCacheStats::invalidations` counts. |
| `rd_count` | **Not recorded.** A slot knows that it holds a chunk, never how much of that chunk a caller took. The class `w0` sorts by therefore does not exist here to be sorted — and note that partial consumption is not the rare case it might sound: an edge chunk of a dataset whose extent is not a multiple of its chunk extent is stored full-size and read in part, which is `rd_count > 0` in C too. |

The second reason is that on the path where a scan would thrash, there is no prune to order at all. A whole read visits each of its chunks exactly once, so it fills the cache and then stops offering rather than giving back chunks it has already placed or been served for chunks it will not ask for again — the problem `w0` exists to soften, removed rather than tuned.

**Which figure reports a too-small budget therefore depends on how the dataset is read**, and each is structurally zero on the other's path:

| read | admission | budget signal |
|---|---|---|
| whole (`read_f64` and friends) | fills the cache, then stops offering | `rejections`; `evictions` stays 0 |
| row window (`read_raw_rows`, `read_*_rows`) | plain LRU, since the chunk its successor needs is the one it finished on | `evictions`; `rejections` stays 0 |

A row window is the one path that does evict, so it is the only place a `w0` analogue could ever pick a different victim. It would not pick a better one: the entry the next window needs is the one this read finished on, which is the most recently used and the last thing an LRU rule gives up, while the partially-consumed entries `w0` would additionally protect are the *leading* boundary chunks that a forward sweep never revisits. That is an argument about the access patterns these readers generate, not a proof for an arbitrary one.

## Dataset-access properties (`dapl`)

Passed to `File::dataset_with_options` / `Group::dataset_with_options` as a `DatasetAccessProperties`, overriding the file-wide access defaults for one dataset.

| HDF5 property (C API) | `hdf5-pure` | Status | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `H5Pset_chunk_cache` | `DatasetAccessProperties::with_chunk_cache` | **Genuine** | Overrides the file-wide chunk cache for this dataset only. Unset means inherit, matching the `H5D_CHUNK_CACHE_*_DEFAULT` sentinels. `rdcc_nslots` and `rdcc_nbytes` map directly; `rdcc_w0` is not modeled, for the reason under [The chunk cache](#the-chunk-cache-rdcc). |
| `H5Pset_efile_prefix` / `H5Pset_virtual_prefix` | none | **Unsupported** | External and virtual datasets are not resolved, so there is no prefix to set. |
| `H5Pset_virtual_view` / `H5Pset_virtual_printf_gap` | none | **Unsupported** | Virtual datasets are not supported. |
| `H5Pset_append_flush` | none | **Unsupported** | No append callback or per-boundary flush; `Dataset::append` flushes on its own schedule. |

## Compliance and known limits

The paged and persistent-free-space paths are exercised by C-library crosschecks (`tests/file_space_crosscheck.rs`, `tests/bounded_append_crosscheck.rs`): the reference library recovers the strategy, `H5Fget_freespace` equals the crate's tracked total exactly, and the C library reopens a paged file read-write and re-paginates it. The crate also reads and bounded-mutates genuine C-created paged and persisted files. Compliance here means page **alignment** and structural validity, not byte-for-byte reproduction of the C allocator's intra-page packing.

Current limits worth knowing:

- **A paged file must persist its free space to be mutated.** Both editors grow a paged `persist = true` file, keeping pages homogeneous and the end of allocation page-aligned; a paged file created **without** `persist = true`, or one carrying a userblock, has no usable record of which pages hold metadata versus raw data and cannot be grown at all — recreate it with `persist = true` and no userblock.
- **Free space is under-reported, never over-reported.** A final metadata-page tail and the old bytes of a relocated partial chunk are left untracked, so `H5Fget_freespace` can read slightly low. The file stays valid.
- **`threshold` is advisory** (see the tables above).
- Only **File Space Info message version 1** is emitted and read.

See [Limitations](limitations.md) for the full catalog of deliberate refusals.
