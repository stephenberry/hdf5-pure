# Editing in Place

`File::open_rw` opens an existing HDF5 file for reading **and** writing, and edits it through owned `Dataset` and `Group` handles that reach every object by name — adding, copying, or deleting objects, or editing attributes, without rewriting the file from scratch. New data and rebuilt object headers are appended at the end of the file and the superblock is repointed last, so the cost is proportional to what changes rather than to the file size, and a failed commit leaves the original file valid.

!!! tip "Runnable example"
    This page mirrors [`examples/edit_in_place.rs`](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/blob/main/examples/edit_in_place.rs). Run it with:

    ```bash
    cargo run --example edit_in_place
    ```

## Choosing a write path

`File::open_rw` is the read-write open, and it picks how to hold the file's bytes from the file itself rather than making you pick a function. A latest-format file with no userblock is edited **bounded**: no whole-file copy is ever built, so memory stays at the [configured caches](streaming.md) plus whatever an edit is building. Anything else — a pre-v2 superblock, or a userblock — falls back to a whole-file **mirror**, `O(file size)`, which is what makes such a file editable at all. Either backing mutates the file the same way: new bytes are appended and a small, fixed set of locations is patched, never a rewrite on commit; see [write paths](../about/architecture.md#write-paths) for the mechanics.

Ask a file which backing it got with `File::edit_backing()`, and demand one with `FileAccessProperties::with_memory_strategy`:

| `MemoryStrategy` | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| unset (the default) | Prefer bounded; fall back to the mirror for a file the bounded engine cannot edit |
| `Bounded` | Never build a mirror; refuse such a file with `Error::EditUnsupported` |
| `Mirrored` | Always build the mirror, whatever the file looks like |

The answer from `File::edit_backing()` is an `EditBacking` (`Bounded` or `Mirrored`) rather than the `MemoryStrategy` that was asked for, because `Auto` is a preference between the two backings and never an outcome; `.into()` converts an `EditBacking` back into the `MemoryStrategy` that pins a later reopen to it.

`File::open_swmr_writer` always mirrors, so it accepts `Auto` and `Mirrored` — both satisfied by the mirror — and refuses an explicit `Bounded` rather than quietly not honoring it.

The two backings are the same engine and the same edit vocabulary — reads, immediate `Dataset::append` / `append_raw`, buffered `Dataset::buffered_appender`, `Dataset::write`, `append_staged`, `set_attr` / `remove_attr`, `Group::create_dataset` / `create_group` / `create_group_with` / `delete`, `File::copy` / `copy_from`, `commit`, and `space_accounting` — with one trade between them. A large `Dataset::append` is one crash-atomic apply on the mirror and several ~1 MiB whole-chunk batches when bounded, so a crash mid-call there leaves a valid shorter dataset. A commit's resident memory follows the backing too: bounded by the edit rather than by the file, with `File::copy` the exception, since copying an object reads the whole of it into memory first.

One caveat inside either backing: the immediate `Dataset::append` is stricter than the staged surface — it needs a latest-format (v2/v3-superblock) file with no userblock, and the refusal (`Error::AppendInPlaceUnsupported`) names `Dataset::append_staged` as the fallback.

The file's [file-space strategy](file-space.md) gates what an edit can do at all, whichever backing holds it:

| File-space strategy | Staged edits + `commit` | Immediate append |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None recorded, or `FsmAggr` / `Aggr` / `None` with `persist = false` | Yes | Yes |
| `FsmAggr` / `Aggr` / `None` with `persist = true` | Yes — freed space is recorded on disk | Yes — managers rewritten at `close` |
| `Page` with `persist = true` | Yes — page-aware commit, per-page-type managers rewritten | Yes — appends stay page-homogeneous |
| `Page` with `persist = false` | No — refused at open | No — refused at open |

The one refusal here is `Error::EditUnsupported` for a paged file that does not persist its free space: neither backing can keep such a file's pages segregated, so `open_rw` refuses it up front rather than letting an edit be staged against it. It fires before any byte of the file changes. (`MemoryStrategy::Mirrored` still opens the file, since that asks for a backing rather than expressing a preference, but a commit through it refuses.) A `Page` / `persist = false` file stays fully readable through every read path and can be rewritten compactly by [repack](repack.md).

A paged commit keeps each page homogeneous — raw data and file metadata never share a page, apart from a chunked dataset's index, which travels with its chunk data (see [File-Space Strategy](file-space.md)) — and page-aligns the end of allocation, so the reference C library reopens the result as a paged file and recovers its free space. A free hole belongs to the page type of the page it sits in, and an allocation draws only on holes of its own type; a page holding nothing at all belongs to neither, so either type may open one.

For a brand-new file, use [`FileBuilder`](writing.md); to append while readers are live, use the [SWMR writer](swmr.md); to compact a file or drop objects across a reopen, use [repack](repack.md). The [file properties reference](../reference/property-support.md) has the corresponding fcpl/fapl support matrix.

## Staging and committing edits

An edit session is transactional: you stage operations on an open file, then apply them all at once with `commit()`. Nothing on disk changes until `commit()` succeeds.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::{AttrValue, File};

let file = File::open_rw("output.h5").unwrap();
let root = file.root();

root.create_group_with("run2", |g| {
    g.set_attr("kind", AttrValue::AsciiString("trial".into()));
})
.unwrap();
root.create_dataset("run2/signal", |b| {
    b.with_f64_data(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
})
.unwrap();
file.copy("temperature", "temperature_backup").unwrap(); // H5Ocopy
root.delete("sensors/pressure").unwrap();                // H5Ldelete

file.commit().unwrap(); // apply everything in place
```

After a successful `commit()`, the staged set is cleared and the open file can be reused for further edits.

## Operations

| Method | Effect | HDF5 analog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `File::open_rw(path)` | Open an existing file for reading and writing | — |
| `Group::create_group(name)` | Stage a new empty group | — |
| `Group::create_group_with(name, build)` | Stage a new group, configured through `build` (attributes, nested objects) | — |
| `Group::create_dataset(name, build)` | Stage a new dataset, configured through a `DatasetBuilder` | — |
| `Dataset::append_staged(build)` | Stage appending elements along axis 0 of an existing chunked, unlimited dataset, via an `AppendBuilder` | `H5Dset_extent` + write |
| `Dataset::append(data)` | Append immediately and durably, no `commit` needed | `H5Dset_extent` + write |
| `Dataset::buffered_appender()` | Buffer appended elements and write them a whole chunk at a time | `H5Pset_chunk_cache` (write side) |
| `Dataset::write(data)` / `write_staged(build)` | Stage a value overwrite of the same datatype and shape | `H5Dwrite` |
| `Group::set_attr(name, value)` / `Dataset::set_attr` | Stage adding or replacing a compact attribute | — |
| `Group::remove_attr(name)` / `Dataset::remove_attr` | Stage removing a compact attribute | — |
| `File::copy(src, dst)` | Stage a deep copy of a dataset or whole group subtree within this file | `H5Ocopy` |
| `File::copy_from(source, src, dst)` | Copy a dataset or subtree out of another open `File` into this one | `H5Ocopy` (across files) |
| `Group::delete(name)` | Stage removing the link at `name` (and, for a group, its whole subtree) | `H5Ldelete` |
| `File::commit()` | Apply all staged operations in place and flush | — |

`create_dataset` hands you the same `DatasetBuilder` used by [`FileBuilder`](writing.md), so you configure the new dataset exactly as you would when creating a file from scratch:

```rust
root.create_dataset("run2/signal", |b| {
    b.with_f64_data(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
})
.unwrap();
```

A new dataset may be created **empty** — zero elements, chunked, with or without an unlimited maximum — which is how a schema-first writer declares its columns before any data has arrived and then grows each one with [`append_staged`](#appending-to-an-unlimited-dataset) as batches come in:

```rust
root.create_dataset("col", |b| {
    b.with_f64_data(&[])
        .with_shape(&[0])
        .with_maxshape(&[u64::MAX])
        .with_chunks(&[512]);
})
.unwrap();
```

The chunk dimensions have to be given: auto-chunking derives them from the shape, and a zero-element shape has none to derive from.

`set_attr` needs a group that already resolves, so a group staged in this same batch is not reachable through it — stage those attributes with `create_group_with` instead. A staged object is not resolvable by name until `commit`, so `File::group`/`File::dataset` will not find it before then.

The `create_group_with`/`create_dataset`/`write_staged`/`append_staged` closures configure a builder rather than the file itself, so a closure may read the same `File` — staging a dataset whose contents depend on one already there works. What it reads is the file as it was before the call, since nothing staged resolves until `commit`.

`set_attr` takes an `AttrValue`, fixed-size or variable-length (`AttrValue::VarLenAsciiArray`). `File::root()` names the root group. Attributes are stored compactly in the rebuilt group header; an edit that would exceed the compact-attribute limit, or a group using dense (fractal-heap) attribute storage, is refused before any file bytes change.

`copy` performs a deep copy: fresh copies of every object's data and header are written, internal links and the contiguous data address are repointed to the copies, and a link named by the last component of `dst` is added to its parent group. The original is untouched. `src` must exist and `dst` must not (and may not lie inside `src`). Compact attributes are carried over byte-for-byte — including the latest-format form the C library and h5py write, where a handful of inline attributes are accompanied by an Attribute Info message. Dense (fractal-heap) attribute storage, which an object takes on above 8 attributes or for a single attribute too large for an object-header message, is also reproduced: the source attributes are read out of the source heap and re-emitted into a fresh single-direct-block fractal heap plus B-tree v2 name index in the destination (the copy tracks only the name index, not the creation-order index). An attribute too large even for a managed heap object is re-emitted as a *huge* object, as it was in the source. More attributes than the single B-tree leaf can index is refused by name rather than mis-encoded; the set's *total* size is not limited, since the heap's one block is sized to the content (see [Limitations](../reference/limitations.md#dense-attribute-storage)).

`copy_from` is the same operation **across two open files** — the cross-file form of `H5Ocopy`. The source lives in a separate [`File`](reading.md) reader rather than the file being edited:

```rust
use hdf5_pure::File;

let library = File::open("library.h5").unwrap();
let file = File::open_rw("output.h5").unwrap();
file.copy_from(&library, "calibration", "run2/calibration").unwrap();
file.commit().unwrap();
```

Unlike `copy`, the source subtree is read and validated **eagerly** (the `File` borrow need not outlive the call), so `copy_from` returns a `Result`; the destination still changes only on `commit()`. Because the copy is byte-for-byte verbatim, anything whose stored bytes embed a *source-file* absolute address — which would dangle in another file — is refused up front: variable-length and reference datasets and attributes (whether compact or dense), and any shared header message (a committed datatype, or an SOHM-shared dataspace, fill value, or filter pipeline). The same-file `copy` keeps these forms valid instead, by sharing the source file's global heaps and objects. The `source` must be a buffered file (`File::open` or `File::from_bytes`, not `File::open_streaming`) using 8-byte offsets and no userblock.

### Replacing an object

Deleting a path and creating something new at that same path in one commit replaces it. The removal is applied before the addition, and the commit's single superblock write publishes both, so a rotating store — a ring buffer of tables, a rolling window of daily datasets — expresses a rotation as one commit rather than two, and the path is never momentarily absent:

```rust
let file = File::open_rw("ring.h5").unwrap();
let root = file.root();

root.delete("t0").unwrap();
root.create_dataset("t0", |b| { b.with_i32_data(&[1, 2, 3]); }).unwrap();
file.commit().unwrap();
```

The replacement need not resemble the original: a dataset may replace a group or the reverse, and replacing a group discards its whole subtree rather than inheriting it.

Everything the commit adds *below* a replaced path lands in the replacement, whatever order the calls were made in — staging `create_dataset("g/x")` and then replacing `g` puts `x` in the new group, not the one being removed. What is refused is a staged edit that could only mean the *original*:

| staged beside `delete("g")` | |
| --- | --- |
| `create_dataset("g/x")` with no replacement of `g` | refused — it would add into a group whose own link the commit removes |
| a group under `g` that the commit does not itself create | refused |
| an attribute set on `g`, or a value overwrite inside it | refused |
| `copy("g/inner", "backup")` — a copy reading from the replaced subtree | refused: a copy takes its bytes from the pre-commit file, so this would place the original at `backup` while the replacement lands at `g` |

A source that is deleted but *not* replaced is unambiguous — that is a move — and stays allowed.

The new object's storage is appended rather than laid over the original's: the original stays live until the superblock is repointed, which is what makes a crash mid-rotation land on one side or the other. The space the deletion released is therefore what a *later* commit draws on, by the two mechanisms [Space reuse and truncation](#space-reuse-and-truncation) describes — reuse for an interior region, truncation for one that reaches the end of the file. A rotation loop in one session reaches a steady file size rather than growing.

## Appending to an unlimited dataset

`Dataset::append_staged` grows an existing **chunked, unlimited** dataset in place along its first (axis-0) dimension, **including filtered** datasets (deflate, shuffle, fletcher32, scale-offset, LZF, and ZFP with the `zfp` feature). It is the general, non-SWMR counterpart to the [SWMR writer](swmr.md), which appends only to *unfiltered*, chunk-aligned datasets. It returns an `AppendBuilder` whose typed and generic methods mirror the writer's; repeated calls concatenate in call order.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::File;

let file = File::open_rw("log.h5").unwrap();
file.dataset("samples")
    .unwrap()
    .append_staged(|a| {
        a.append_i32(&[8, 9, 10, 11]);
    })
    .unwrap();
file.commit().unwrap();
```

Existing chunks stay exactly where they are. Only the newly appended chunks — plus the single trailing partial chunk, when the dataset's current length is not a whole multiple of the chunk length — are compressed and written; every other chunk is carried into the rebuilt index by metadata alone. So an append does not rewrite existing data and the file does not grow by the whole dataset each time. Appends of any length are allowed, and the datatype, fill value, filter pipeline, and attributes are preserved.

Like every staged edit, an append commits by writing the new chunks and a rebuilt index at end-of-file and repointing the superblock last (under the file's exclusive lock), so a crash leaves either the original dataset or the fully grown one, never a torn state. It sets no SWMR flag.

### Eligibility

The first release supports the Extensible-Array chunk index — the index the reference C library and h5py select for a single unlimited dimension under the latest format, and the one this crate writes for every unlimited dataset — with rank-1 datasets that have a single hard link. A dataset that is not chunked, not unlimited along axis 0, not Extensible-Array indexed, higher than rank 1, uses a filter this engine cannot re-encode, or has a sparse chunk grid is refused with `Error::AppendUnsupported` before any file bytes change. Check eligibility up front with the read-side accessors [`is_chunked`, `maxshape`, `chunk_shape`, and `filters`](reading.md#chunking-filters-and-append-eligibility) rather than relying on the refusal error.

Element types are checked, never coerced: each typed `append_*` call records the datatype it implies, and `commit` refuses a mismatch against the dataset's on-disk datatype — including a mix of element types in one builder. `append_raw` appends already-little-endian element bytes verbatim; its length must be a whole multiple of the element size and the dataset's datatype must be little-endian.

!!! tip "Runnable example"
    This section mirrors [`examples/append_dataset.rs`](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/blob/main/examples/append_dataset.rs). Run it with `cargo run --example append_dataset`.

### Streaming appends

`append_staged` rebuilds the dataset's chunk index and relocates its header on every `commit` (and each new `File::open_rw` re-reads the metadata it needs, or the whole file when it falls back to the mirror), which is the right trade for a one-off append composed alongside other edits, but not for a high-frequency append loop. For that, open the file **once** with `File::open_rw` and append many times through a `Dataset` handle, growing the Extensible-Array index *in place* — so each append costs `O(appended bytes)` plus amortized `O(1)` index overhead, with no whole-file re-read and no index rebuild.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::File;

let file = File::open_rw("log.h5").unwrap();
let mut samples = file.dataset("samples").unwrap();
samples.append(&[8i32, 9, 10, 11]).unwrap();
samples.append(&[12i32, 13]).unwrap(); // unfiltered: any length
file.close().unwrap();
```

One open file reaches every dataset by name, takes an exclusive file lock for its lifetime, and sets no SWMR flag. **Every `append` is crash-atomic**: writes are ordered child-before-parent with `fsync` barriers and the dataspace dimension is published last as the single commit point, so a crash between appends leaves either the previous length or the new one — never a torn or lost view. Throughout this page, "crash-atomic" means that ordering holds against a process crash under either [`SyncPolicy`](#choosing-the-fsync-cadence), and against power loss under the default one.

That atomicity is why filtered and unfiltered datasets have different rules about *where* an append may start. An **unfiltered** append may start anywhere: when the current length is not chunk-aligned, the trailing partial chunk is rewritten and its index element — a single chunk address — is repointed with one atomic write. A **filtered** append must start on a **chunk boundary**, because a filtered index element is a multi-field record whose in-place repoint is not power-loss atomic, and the trailing chunk's element is one a reader can already see. To grow a filtered dataset that is sitting on a partial trailing chunk, use `Dataset::append_staged`, which rebuilds the index and repoints the superblock last (fully atomic), or a [`BufferedAppender`](#buffered-appends), which keeps the on-disk length chunk-aligned for you.

The appended **length** is unconstrained either way. An unaligned length only makes the last chunk the append writes a partial one, and that chunk's index element is a fresh insert past the old dimension — invisible until the dimension is published, exactly like every whole chunk beside it. It does leave the dataset on a partial trailing chunk, which is what the rule above then catches.

The remaining eligibility rules match `Dataset::append_staged` (chunked, unlimited axis 0, Extensible-Array index, rank 1, a re-encodable filter pipeline), plus the file-level gates in [the tables above](#choosing-a-write-path), with one difference: because it grows the index in place rather than rebuilding it, the index must already be allocated. This crate allocates it eagerly, so an empty dataset it wrote can be grown from the first append; an empty dataset the C library created without any initial data defers its index and is refused — make that first append with `Dataset::append_staged` (which materializes the index), or create the dataset with initial data. The dead bytes left when an unfiltered partial chunk is relocated are reclaimed by [repack](repack.md) rather than reused within the session in this release. This is the throughput-oriented counterpart to `Dataset::append_staged` and the filter-capable counterpart to the [SWMR writer](swmr.md).

!!! tip "Runnable example"
    This section mirrors [`examples/append_streaming.rs`](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/blob/main/examples/append_streaming.rs). Run it with `cargo run --example append_streaming`.

### Buffered appends

`Dataset::append` writes on every call: it encodes the appended elements, places their chunks, extends the index, and fsyncs five times (per batch, and under the default [`SyncPolicy`](#choosing-the-fsync-cadence)). That is the right trade for a caller appending a chunk at a time, and the wrong one for a caller appending a hundred elements at a time into a chunk that holds a thousand — which pays the whole sequence ten times over to write one chunk, and cannot pay it at all once the dataset is filtered and sitting on a partial trailing chunk.

`Dataset::buffered_appender` returns a `BufferedAppender` that holds appended elements in memory and writes them only when they complete a chunk. It is this crate's equivalent of the reference C library's raw-data chunk cache, and it carries the same bargain: buffered elements are not in the file until the appender flushes.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::File;

let file = File::open_rw("telemetry.h5").unwrap();
let mut samples = file.dataset("samples").unwrap();
let mut appender = samples.buffered_appender().unwrap();
for batch in 0..1000 {
    appender.append(&[batch as f64; 100]).unwrap(); // buffered; writes once a chunk fills
}
appender.finish().unwrap();                         // the partial tail reaches the file here
```

Every call that does not complete a chunk is a memory copy and nothing else. When one or more chunks are complete, exactly those chunks go through the immediate, crash-atomic in-place path and the remainder stays buffered — so a filtered dataset is appended by **any length**, and a caller appending `k` elements at a time into a chunk of `n` writes once per `n/k` calls instead of once per call.

Each write the appender makes is itself crash-atomic, so a crash loses the buffered tail and never the file: the dataset reads back as the prefix that was written. `flush` publishes the buffered tail without consuming the appender, `finish` flushes and consumes it, and dropping without either still flushes — but a failure there cannot be reported, so prefer `finish` where the error matters. Eligibility is the same as `Dataset::append`'s and is reported when the appender is constructed, not on the first write.

One case costs more. A filtered dataset whose on-disk length is not a whole multiple of its chunk length — a log resumed across sessions, typically — has a partial trailing chunk the appender cannot grow in place. It lands such a dataset back on a chunk boundary with one staged, index-rebuilding commit, and every write after that is the cheap in-place one; so the cost is paid once when the log is opened, not once per append. Because that recovery commits, it is refused while the session holds unrelated staged edits. Flushing a partial chunk mid-stream leaves the length unaligned again, so an appender that flushes after every batch pays that commit on every batch but the first — let the appender batch where the last few elements can wait.

An appender holds elements the caller was already told were accepted, and only its own flush can write them — and the immediate append path refuses a dataset with a staged edit on it or an ancestor. So while an appender is live the session **refuses that edit at the call that makes it**, with `Error::EditUnsupported`, rather than letting the flush fail later where a `Drop` could not report it: any edit naming the dataset or an ancestor, every staged edit at all while the realignment above is still owed, and a second appender on the same dataset. Prefer `finish` (or `flush`) over dropping anyway, since a drop cannot return an error; what stays outside the guarantee is `File::close`, which does not flush live appenders.

A **SWMR** writer requires the appended length to be chunk-aligned as well, so it can never write a partial trailing chunk; `buffered_appender` refuses such a session outright rather than accepting elements it could not flush.

Memory follows the buffer rather than the file: an appender holds the unwritten elements plus a copy of the prefix it is writing, so peak is about twice the chunk size above whatever one call hands it. That is a different bound from the one [`Dataset::append`](#bounded-memory-appends) gives, which is independent of how much a single call appends.

!!! tip "Runnable example"

### Bounded-memory appends

Appending to a large file needs no special entry point: `File::open_rw` already edits a latest-format file bounded, the read-write sibling of [`open_streaming`](streaming.md). Reads are served by positioned I/O with the streaming backend's capabilities, and `Dataset::append` runs the same crash-atomic in-place engine as the mirror, reading and patching only bounded windows (the object header, the extensible-array blocks it touches, and the trailing chunk). A large append is applied in whole-chunk batches, each crash-atomic on its own, so peak memory stays at the configured caches plus a few chunks — independent of the file size and of how much one call appends.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::{EditBacking, File, FileAccessProperties, MemoryStrategy};

// Bounded because the file allows it; add the hint to make it a requirement
// rather than a preference.
let file = File::open_rw_with_options(
    "huge-log.h5",
    FileAccessProperties::new().with_memory_strategy(MemoryStrategy::Bounded),
).unwrap();
assert_eq!(file.edit_backing(), Some(EditBacking::Bounded));
let mut samples = file.dataset("samples").unwrap();
samples.append(&[8i32, 9, 10, 11]).unwrap();
file.close().unwrap();
```

Bounded editing **does** grow a file that persists its free space — including a genuine paged file (`H5F_FSPACE_STRATEGY_PAGE`) — seeding the on-disk free-space managers on open and rewriting them at `File::close`, with paged appends kept page-homogeneous (raw and metadata in separate pages). See [File-Space Strategy](file-space.md) for the paged details. Memory budgets are set with the same `FileAccessProperties` as the streaming reader; cached metadata windows touched by an append are invalidated automatically, so reads through the same file never observe stale bytes.

## How it works

`commit()` appends each new dataset (its data blob and object header) and each new group, then appends rewritten object headers for every touched group and its ancestors up to the root (omitting any deleted links), and finally repoints the superblock at the new root.

The appended data is `fsync`ed before the root is repointed, so the "repoint last" guarantee is real: if the process or machine fails during a commit, the original file is still intact and readable, because the superblock still points at the old root. (Under `SyncPolicy::OnClose` the repoint is still last, but during the session only a *process* failure is ordered against — see [Choosing the fsync cadence](#choosing-the-fsync-cadence).) The cost of a commit scales with the size of the edit, not the size of the file.

!!! warning "All-or-nothing safety"
    Every check runs before the first byte is written. On any `Error::EditUnsupported`, the file on disk is left untouched. This makes editing safe to attempt: an unsupported edit fails cleanly rather than producing a partially modified or corrupt file.

A refusal costs the session nothing it had staged, so nothing is lost by attempting a commit. A refused `commit()` puts the staged set back whole — `has_staged_edits()` still answers `true`, and committing again gives the same refusal rather than applying the part of the batch the refusal was not about. A staging call that refuses stages nothing, including a `create_group_with` whose closure had already recorded several edits before the refused one.

Which errors arrive where follows from that: a dataset is validated as it is staged, so a bad shape, a missing datatype or an unsupported combination is reported by `create_dataset` or `write_staged` itself, while anything that has to read the file — a value overwrite that is not the on-disk datatype or shape, a deletion that overlaps another edit, a target that does not exist — is reported by `commit()`.

A value overwrite is decided that way too. It replaces element bytes and nothing else, so a builder asking for chunking, filters, an extensible shape, an attribute or a fill value is refused by the staging call, and so are the two datatypes whose element bytes are placeholders only a newly created dataset can resolve: variable-length strings (`with_vlen_strings`) and path-resolved object references (`with_path_references`). `with_reference_data` supplies its addresses already resolved and overwrites like any other value.

## Choosing the fsync cadence

Those barriers are `fsync`s, and by default there is one at every durability point: five per append *batch* (a `Dataset::append` larger than about a megabyte is applied in several), two or three per commit, one at `close`. That is a strong guarantee and a real cost, and an application that wants durability at its own cadence instead sets `SyncPolicy` on the fapl.

```rust
use hdf5_pure::{File, FileAccessProperties, SyncPolicy};

let file = File::open_rw_with_options(
    "log.h5",
    FileAccessProperties::new().with_sync_policy(SyncPolicy::OnClose),
).unwrap();

let mut samples = file.dataset("samples").unwrap();
for batch in 0..1000 {
    samples.append(&[batch as f64; 64]).unwrap();  // no fsync
}
file.close().unwrap();   // applies staged edits, then one fsync
```

`SyncPolicy::OnClose` is close to what the reference C library does: its default `sec2` driver installs no flush callback at all, so `H5Fflush` drains libhdf5's caches with `write` and stops there, leaving power-loss durability to the application. It is not a write-back cache: every commit and every append has reached the operating system by the time it returns, under either policy — see [Write gathering](#write-gathering) for what is held back and for how long. A file written under `OnClose` is byte-identical to the same file written under `Always`, is visible to other processes on the machine once the operation that wrote it returns, and survives *this process* crashing.

Three things are given up, and they are worth separating:

- **Power-loss ordering.** With the barriers gone, a machine that loses power mid-commit can have the superblock repoint on disk without the data it points at.
- **Deferred write errors.** On a filesystem that allocates late, a write that will fail at writeback still returns success, and the `fsync` is where the `ENOSPC` or `EIO` surfaces. Skip it and a commit the filesystem cannot complete returns `Ok`, with nothing left to report it.
- **Cross-host visibility.** "Another process sees it" is the page cache, so it holds on a local filesystem. Under NFS's close-to-open semantics a client may hold writes until a flush, so a reader on another host — including a [SWMR](swmr.md) reader — may not see them.

### Why the last one is not optional

`File::sync()` is the checkpoint the application issues itself, wherever it wants one. It writes nothing: staged edits still need a `commit()`, and elements held by a `BufferedAppender` need a `flush()`. It only forces what is already written.

The barrier at the end is a different thing, and it is the reason this policy is `OnClose` rather than a literal "never". `close()` is not a passive call — it applies any staged edits, re-homes the free-space managers of a file that persists them, and clears a SWMR writer's flag — and it *consumes the handle*, so those writes land past the last point a caller could have ordered them. Dropping the last handle does the same, with no return value to report an error through. A policy that skipped the barrier there would not be handing you a cadence; it would be taking one away, since no `sync()` you could write reaches those bytes. So `close` and `drop` each issue exactly one `fsync`, under every policy.

The arithmetic makes this a cheap promise to keep: one barrier per session, against the five per append batch and two or three per commit that `OnClose` removes. A thousand-append session goes from about five thousand `fsync`s to one.

A file left flagged by a SWMR writer is the sharpest case. That flag is cleared at teardown, and a lost clear means every later open is refused with `Error::FileMarkedInUse` until `File::clear_swmr_flag` runs — a failure that costs availability rather than freshness, on a write the caller never sees.

The whole-file paths are outside all of this: `FileBuilder::write` and [`repack`](repack.md) never `fsync` under either policy, since each writes a file and hands it over rather than holding an editing session.

The default is `SyncPolicy::Always`, which is every guarantee described above this section.

## Write gathering

A commit or an in-place append is not one write. A single append issues the chunk's bytes at end-of-file and then patches an index element, a checksum, the array header's statistics, the dataspace dimension, and the superblock's recorded end-of-file — eight writes on a measured file, seven of them a few bytes each, landing in a handful of pages that the *next* append patches again. Issued one at a time, that is seven syscalls and seven page dirtyings for a few dozen bytes, and on flash a page dirtied seven times is written seven times.

Every read-write session therefore gathers its writes and emits **one write per dirty page**. The bytes it holds are released at every *ordering barrier* — the points the commit and append sequences already define, where writes made before must reach the disk before writes made after — so:

- a commit or an append that has returned has put its bytes in the operating system, whatever the `SyncPolicy` says, because every operation ends with a barrier;
- nothing about crash safety changes: the barriers keep their ordering meaning under both policies, so a write that fails still leaves the file in the state it had before the operation;
- nothing about the resulting file changes — the bytes are identical either way.

A session appending one chunk to each of eight datasets, four times over, issued 160 writes where it made 256 — and 448 before the separate reduction in what an append writes at all.

There is no setting for this and nothing to opt into. The one session that does *not* gather is the [SWMR](swmr.md) writer, whose readers follow its ordered phases as they become visible; coalescing those would not make a smaller file, it would let a reader see a state the phases exist to hide.

## Supported targets and formats

Contiguous and chunked datasets (with any filter the whole-file writer supports) and compact-link groups are supported. The editor works across every on-disk format the reference HDF5 C library and h5py produce:

- Version 0, 1, 2, and 3 superblocks.
- Single- and multi-chunk object headers. A multi-chunk header is collapsed into a single chunk on rewrite.
- A version 0/1 symbol-table group on the edited path is converted to the latest compact-link format. Adding and deleting are supported on these older files; copying a version-1 object is not.

Rather than silently degrade a file, the editor refuses anything it cannot reproduce faithfully, returning `Error::EditUnsupported`:

- A file whose superblock is not located at its base address — a relocated or malformed userblock layout. (A canonical userblock, such as a MATLAB v7.3 `.mat` file's 512-byte userblock, is supported: addresses are read and written relative to the base and the userblock bytes are preserved.)
- Dense-storage headers on the edited path.
- Copying an existing version-1 object.
- Across files (`copy_from`): variable-length or reference datasets and attributes, any shared (committed/SOHM) header message, and a streaming source file — none of which can be reproduced verbatim in another file.

See [`Error::EditUnsupported`](../reference/data-types.md) for the full set of refusals.

## Space reuse and truncation

Within a session, the space a deletion frees is reused for later writes, so add/delete churn stays bounded instead of only ever growing the file. If a freed run reaches the end of the file, the file is truncated.

Everything a commit writes can go into freed space: object headers, contiguous data, a chunked dataset's chunk data and index, and a dense attribute heap. Each needs a region large enough to hold it whole — a dataset larger than every free region is written past the end of the file, not split across two holes.

Contiguous and chunked datasets (chunk index plus chunk data) and whole group subtrees are reclaimed. Reclaim is best-effort: an object whose blocks cannot be enumerated exhaustively (variable-length global-heap storage, dense attribute or link heaps, a version 2 B-tree chunk index) is left as dead bytes rather than risk freeing a region still in use.

On a paged file (`FileSpaceStrategy::Page`) an allocation is served from free space of the page type it is writing, or from a page that is wholly free — one with nothing in it holds no type to contradict — so reuse cannot make metadata and raw data share a page. The free-space managers a commit rewrites are placed the same way, rather than into a page of their own, which is what keeps a delete-and-recreate workload from growing a page per commit. Freed space whose page type cannot be established — a whole-file-generic free section recorded by another writer, or a chunk index that writer placed among its metadata — is recorded but never handed out, which costs some space rather than the page separation.

An immediate `Dataset::append` always writes at the end of the file; only staged edits applied by `commit()` draw on free space. One consequence of reuse is worth knowing for read-heavy workloads: a dataset written into a fragmented file may have its chunks placed in several holes rather than in one run, so a sequential read of it fetches each chunk separately instead of coalescing adjacent ones. [Repacking](repack.md) restores a single run.

!!! note "Cross-session reuse and guaranteed compaction"
    By default, freed space is reused only within the open session and forgotten on close. For a file created with `H5Pset_file_space_strategy(persist = true)`, freed space is recorded on disk and survives reopen; see [File-space strategy](file-space.md). For a guaranteed shrink that rewrites the whole file compact across a reopen, see [Reclaiming space with repack](repack.md).

## Verifying edits

Reopen the file with [`File::open`](reading.md) to confirm the edits landed:

```rust
use hdf5_pure::File;

let file = File::open("output.h5").unwrap();
let signal = file.dataset("run2/signal").unwrap().read_f64().unwrap();
let backup = file.dataset("temperature_backup").unwrap().read_f64().unwrap();
let run2_attrs = file.group("run2").unwrap().attrs().unwrap();

assert_eq!(signal, vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
assert_eq!(backup, vec![22.5, 23.1, 21.8]);
assert!(file.dataset("sensors/pressure").is_err());
```
