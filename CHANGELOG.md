# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this crate follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) under Cargo's pre-1.0 conventions: a `0.x.0` bump may be breaking, `0.x.y` is not.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Generic, type-parameterized dataset I/O: `DatasetBuilder::with_data(&[T])` writes any supported scalar and `Dataset::read::<T>()` reads one back, so you can write code generic over the element type instead of reaching for `with_i64_data` / `read_i64` and friends. Backed by the now feature-independent `H5Element` bound (previously available only with the `ndarray` feature). Both delegate to the existing typed methods, so behavior is unchanged ([#53](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/53)).
- Per-dataset chunk-cache control: `File::dataset_with_options` / `Group::dataset_with_options` take a `DatasetAccessOptions` that overrides the file-wide chunk-cache default for a single dataset, mirroring HDF5's `H5Pset_chunk_cache` access property list. `Dataset::chunk_cache_config()` reports the effective setting ([#48](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/48)).
- `Dataset::chunk_cache_stats()` reports a read-only snapshot of a dataset's chunk-cache occupancy (index loaded, retained chunks, retained bytes), so callers can confirm their chunk-cache tuning is taking effect.
- A gallery of runnable, self-checking examples in `examples/` covering the core API: write/read, generic element I/O, groups & attributes, compression, compound & complex types, ndarray, in-place editing, repack, SWMR, and file-space strategy. Run any with `cargo run --example <name>` ([#54](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/54)).
- OS advisory file locking on the write/edit/read open paths, the crash-safe half of HDF5's concurrency model and the analogue of `H5Pset_file_locking`. Writers (`SwmrWriter`, `EditSession`) take an exclusive lock and a second writer (or a non-SWMR reader) gets the new `Error::FileLocked`; plain reads take a shared lock; `File::open_swmr` takes none. The kernel releases the lock on any process exit (including a crash), so a crashed writer leaves no stale lock. Control it with the new `FileLocking` policy (`open_with_locking`, `FileAccessOptions::with_file_locking`) or `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE` for filesystems where locking is unavailable ([#73](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/73)).

### Changed

- 32-bit / WASM hardening: the chunked-data and MATLAB matrix readers now return an error instead of silently truncating when a file-derived dimension or element count exceeds the platform's pointer width. Every remaining narrowing `as` cast in the library is now either a checked conversion or carries an `#[expect(…, reason = "…")]` justifying why it is bounded, enforced by a hard deny of the narrowing-cast lints on a 32-bit CI target — replacing the previous count-based ratchet, which a new cast could slip past by removing an unrelated one ([#72](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/72)).

### Fixed

- Read dense groups and dense attributes whose link/attribute names are very long (stored as fractal-heap "huge" objects); previously failed with `InvalidObjectHeaderVersion` ([#63](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/63)).
- `EditSession` now clears the superblock's write/SWMR consistency flag on commit instead of preserving whatever the source file carried, so editing a file an interrupted SWMR writer left flagged produces a cleanly-closed file the reference C library can reopen ([#73](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/73)).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-15

Completes free-space management ([#21](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/21)) and closes several interoperability gaps with the reference HDF5 C library. Additive minor bump.

### Added

- File-space strategy on the file-creation property list: `FileBuilder::with_file_space_strategy` and `with_file_space_page_size`, read back with `File::file_space_strategy()` / `File::file_space_info()` ([#55](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/55)). Mirrors `H5Pset_file_space_strategy` / `H5Pset_file_space_page_size`.
- `File::persisted_free_space()` reads the on-disk free-space managers of a file written with `persist = true` ([#56](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/56)).
- `EditSession` persists free space across reopen: it seeds its free list from the on-disk managers and writes it back on commit, so freed space is reused by later sessions instead of leaking ([#58](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/58)).

### Fixed

- The reference C library can now add objects to files this crate writes (group headers were missing a Group Info message, which the C library requires before inserting a link) ([#59](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/59)).
- Read large dense groups whose fractal heap grows a multi-row root indirect block (~150+ links) ([#60](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/60)).
- Read large dense groups whose name index is a 3-or-more-level v2 B-tree (~26k+ links) ([#62](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/62)).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-15

Free-space management ([#21](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/21), [#45](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/45)).

### Added

- `EditSession` now reuses space freed by earlier commits and truncates the file when free space reaches the end, so add/delete churn stays bounded instead of growing the file every commit.
- Whole-file `repack(src, dst, &RepackOptions)` rewrites a file with no dead space, optionally dropping objects (`RepackOptions::new().drop_path("grp/old")`). It refuses with `Error::RepackUnsupported` rather than silently degrade anything it cannot reproduce exactly (e.g. variable-length, reference, or lossy-filtered data).

### Fixed

- `Datatype::serialize` produced empty bytes for the time, bit-field, and opaque datatype classes, corrupting any datatype message that used one of them ([#45](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/45)).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-10

Internal robustness and tests ([#26](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/26)); no public API or on-disk-format change.

### Added

- Property-based tests for the write/read roundtrip and parser robustness ([#44](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/44)).
- A Miri CI job covering the crate's only non-trivial `unsafe` (the aligned chunk buffer) ([#43](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/43)).

### Changed

- Internal cleanup of B-tree v1 size arithmetic into named helpers ([#42](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/pull/42)).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `EditSession` edits object headers that span multiple chunks (e.g. objects carrying several attributes) ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)).
- `EditSession` edits version 0/1 (symbol-table) files in place — the default format from the C library and h5py ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)). Adding and deleting is supported; copying a version-1 object is not.

### Fixed

- `EditSession::commit` now `fsync`s appended data before repointing the root, making its "repoint last" crash-safety guarantee real ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- In-place file editing via `EditSession` ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)): `open(path)`, then `create_dataset` / `create_group` / `delete` / `copy`, applied by `commit()`. Changes are appended and the superblock repointed last, so cost scales with the edit, not the file size, and a failed commit leaves the file valid. It refuses with `Error::EditUnsupported` cases it cannot reproduce faithfully (userblocks, pre-1.10 formats, dense storage, chunked/compressed new datasets). Freed space is not reclaimed (see [#21](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/21)).
- File inspection: `is_hdf5(path)` / `is_hdf5_bytes(&[u8])`, `File::file_size()`, and `File::libver_bound()` (new `LibVer` enum) ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)).
- `FileBuilder::with_libver_bounds(low, high)`, mirroring `H5Pset_libver_bounds` ([#32](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/32)). This crate writes one format (the 1.10+ version-3 superblock), so it acts as a compatibility guard: `finish()` fails with `FormatError::LibverBoundsUnsatisfiable` if the bounds exclude that format.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the public API is now a curated surface; internal format modules are `pub(crate)` ([#33](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/33)). Code using the documented reader/writer/builder API is unaffected; code reaching into internal module paths (e.g. `hdf5_pure::object_header::…`) must stop.

### Added

- `Dataset::verify_provenance` (feature `provenance`) checks a dataset against the `_provenance_sha256` hash written by `with_provenance`.

### Removed

- The `fast-checksum` feature and its `crc32fast` dependency — it gated unused CRC32 code (HDF5 uses lookup3). Drop it from any feature list that named it.
- Several internal subsystems that were never wired into the reader or writer.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-08

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `parallel_read::decompress_chunks_parallel` and `decompress_chunks_sequential` — public but unused ([#33](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/33)). Reader/writer code is unaffected. CI now runs `cargo-semver-checks` to catch unintended API changes.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Streaming reads for files too large to buffer: `File::open_streaming(path)` reads metadata and chunks on demand instead of loading the whole file ([#27](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/27)). Streams contiguous, compact, and all chunk-index layouts; limited to latest-format groups, and attribute reading is not yet supported. The buffered `File::open` path is unchanged.
- 32-bit and bare-metal robustness ([#27](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/27)): file offsets/lengths that do not fit the platform now error (`ValueTooLargeForPlatform` / `OffsetOverflow`) instead of truncating. CI runs the suite on 32-bit (i686) and builds for `thumbv7em-none-eabi` `no_std`.
- N-dimensional array I/O via the optional `ndarray` feature ([#24](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/24)): `DatasetBuilder::with_ndarray` and `Dataset::read_array` / `read_array_dyn`. Off by default; implies `std`.

### Changed

- Writing a dataset whose shape disagrees with the data now fails with `FormatError::ShapeDataMismatch` instead of producing an unreadable file.

### Removed

- The `mmap` feature and its `memmap2` dependency — declared but never implemented ([#24](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/24)). Drop it if you named it.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- SWMR (single-writer / multiple-reader) support for 1-D, unlimited, Extensible-Array-indexed datasets ([#17](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/17)):
  - `File::open_swmr(path)` plus `File::refresh()` re-read data appended by a concurrent writer.
  - `SwmrWriter::open(path)` appends chunks in place (`append_i32` / `append_f64` / `append_raw`), ordered so a reader or a crashed writer only ever sees a consistent prefix. `close()` clears the SWMR flag; `clear_swmr_flag(path)` recovers a file left flagged by a crash.
  - Limited to unfiltered, chunk-aligned, single-unlimited-dimension datasets; unsupported targets are rejected with `Error::SwmrAppendUnsupported`. Requires `std`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Error` and `FormatError` are now `#[non_exhaustive]`; `match` over them needs a wildcard arm. Future variant additions are now non-breaking.

### Fixed

- Extensible Array chunk index: reading more than 20 chunks returned wrong data and writing more than 244 silently dropped the excess ([#17](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/17)).

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Scale-offset filter (HDF5 filter id 6), read and write, via `.with_scale_offset(mode)` ([#13](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/13)). Integer mode is lossless; float decimal-scaling is lossy. Datasets compressed with it by other tools now decode instead of failing with `UnsupportedFilter(6)`.

## [0.5.1]

### Fixed

- Chunked datasets indexed by a Fixed Array now use the paged data block layout above the page size (>1024 chunks at the default), and the reader decodes them; previously such files were written corrupt and rejected on read ([#14](https://github.com/stephenberry/hdf5-pure/issues/14)).

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- serde roundtrip for `Matrix<Complex64>` / `Matrix<Complex32>`, including empty matrices (which previously lost their complex class).
- Sealed `mat::MatElement` trait, so an unsupported element type is a compile error rather than a silent class loss.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Matrix<T>` serde now requires `T: MatElement` instead of `T: 'static`. Such uses previously produced malformed MAT files at runtime.
- The MAT deserializer flattens 1×N and N×1 values to a 1-D sequence in `deserialize_any` (matching `deserialize_seq`).
- Numeric/complex readers preserve 1×N / N×1 shape at the value layer; any flattening happens at the serde level.
