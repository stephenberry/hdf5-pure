//! Complex number newtypes recognized by the MAT serializer.
//!
//! These use a sentinel struct name so the generic MAT serializer can detect
//! complex values and write them as HDF5 compound `{real, imag}` datasets,
//! which is how MATLAB stores complex arrays in v7.3 files.
//!
//! For `Vec<Complex64>` the serializer produces a compound dataset of shape
//! `[1, N]`; a bare `Complex64` becomes a compound scalar of shape `[1, 1]`.
//!
//! There is one type per component class, because the component class *is* the
//! array's MATLAB class: a [`ComplexI16`] array reports `int16`, not some
//! complex-specific class, and a capture that samples as pairs of 16-bit
//! integers stores in half the space its `single` equivalent would take.
//! Nothing is ever widened on the way in or out — a value written as
//! [`ComplexI16`] reads back only as [`ComplexI16`], so the file always says
//! what it holds.
//!
//! For a large array, reach for the [`i16_array`]-style helpers below rather
//! than letting serde walk the elements: a sentinel struct per sample costs
//! about 26 ns, which is most of what writing a capture takes.
