//! Configuration knobs for MAT v7.3 writers.
//!
//! [`Options`] groups every policy a MATLAB writer might need to flex on:
//! string class (`char` vs `string`), 1-D vector orientation, name validation
//! behavior, compression, and more.
//!
//! The defaults match the historical hdf5-pure serde writer (`String -> char`,
//! no name sanitization, no compression, column vectors). Callers wanting the
//! richer "modern MATLAB" output should construct an `Options` with explicit
//! `string_class: StringClass::String`, `invalid_name_policy: Sanitize`, etc.
