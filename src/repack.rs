//! Whole-file repack (issue #21): copy an existing HDF5 file into a fresh,
//! compact one, optionally dropping objects.
//!
//! [`File::open_rw`](crate::File::open_rw) deletes objects in place but reclaims
//! space only within a session and cannot return a single deleted-and-closed
//! file's bytes to the OS. Repack is the complementary answer — the same one the
//! HDF5 C ecosystem ships as `h5repack`: it reads every surviving object and
//! rewrites the whole file from scratch through [`FileBuilder`], so the result
//! has no dead space and is strictly smaller when objects are dropped.
//!
//! # Fidelity contract
//!
//! Repack never silently degrades data. Every surviving object is reproduced
//! faithfully — datatype, shape, max-shape, chunking, filters, and byte-exact
//! element data — or the whole operation fails with [`Error::RepackUnsupported`]
//! naming the object and the reason. It refuses rather than approximate.
//! Currently reproducible:
//!
//! - Datasets with fixed-point, floating-point, time, fixed-length string,
//!   bit-field, opaque, compound, enumeration, and array datatypes,
//!   contiguous/compact or chunked.
//! - **Chunked** datasets copy their compressed chunks **verbatim** (chunk by
//!   chunk, never decoded), so *every* filter is preserved byte-exact: deflate,
//!   shuffle, fletcher32, integer **and** float scale-offset, ZFP, SZIP, and
//!   even filters this crate cannot itself apply. The destination always uses a
//!   v4 chunk index (single-chunk / fixed-array / extensible-array) regardless
//!   of the source index type.
//! - **Variable-length** datasets (1D and ND, contiguous/compact as well as
//!   chunked, filtered, or resizable): string-shaped (`is_string: true` and the
//!   MATLAB VLEN-of-1-byte-ASCII-string shape) and non-string sequences over any
//!   base type that embeds no addresses. Each element's exact heap bytes are read
//!   and re-staged through a fresh global heap, preserving charset, padding, the
//!   null-vs-empty distinction, embedded NULs, and non-UTF-8 payloads, and the
//!   source's chunk geometry, filters, and resizability are carried onto the
//!   rebuilt dataset.
//! - Datatypes that *contain* an address without being one — a compound with a
//!   variable-length member, an object-reference member, or both; an array of
//!   such compounds; and nesting of either. The embedded heap references are
//!   re-staged and the embedded object addresses resolved exactly as their
//!   top-level counterparts are, in a single pass, while every other byte of the
//!   element is carried through untouched.
//! - Contiguous/compact **object-reference** datasets, and contiguous/compact
//!   datatypes containing an object-reference member: each stored address is
//!   rewritten to its target object's new location in the compacted file (null
//!   and undefined references are carried verbatim). A reference to a committed
//!   datatype object is one of those targets, since it is an object like any
//!   other.
//! - **Committed (`H5Tcommit`) datatypes**: the named datatype object is
//!   recreated at the same path, and every dataset and attribute that named it
//!   names the *same* object in the output rather than getting an inline copy of
//!   the encoding, so `h5dump` still reports `DATATYPE "/mytype"` and the
//!   object's reference count still matches its users.
//! - **Unallocated storage**: a dataset the reference library created and never
//!   wrote to holds nothing, and comes out holding nothing rather than holding
//!   the fill value a read answers with for every element it declares (issue
//!   #293). A *resizable* destination keeps the eagerly built chunk index every
//!   empty resizable dataset here gets, since an in-place append needs one to
//!   exist; it stores no chunk either way.
//! - Group hierarchy of arbitrary depth.
//! - Attributes, on datasets, groups, and root, carried across with the
//!   encoding the source gave them rather than rebuilt from an [`AttrValue`],
//!   which is a decoded view and cannot express a narrow width, a
//!   variable-length string, or a rank above one.
//! - The source file's file-space management strategy (with its page size and
//!   threshold), carried into the compact output as non-persistent — a repacked
//!   file has no free space to persist.
//!
//! The verbatim chunk copy never decodes, so it eliminates the
//! decompress→recompress round-trip and the per-dataset decompression blowup,
//! and a lossy filter survives byte-exact. Two paths still re-encode and so
//! require **lossless** filters: a *contiguous/compact* filtered dataset, and a
//! *sparse* chunked dataset (one with unallocated chunk-grid holes, which the
//! dense verbatim path cannot lay out). A lossy pipeline on either of those is
//! refused.
//!
//! Refused (named, never dropped silently): chunked, filtered, or resizable
//! datasets whose datatype is or contains an object reference (their element
//! addresses are resolved as elements are re-staged, which a compressed chunk
//! would need rewritten in place);
//! region references and
//! non-8-byte object references; an object reference to a dropped object or to a
//! target outside the hard-link hierarchy (a dangling or region target), and
//! object references in a userblock file (non-zero base address); a
//! non-string vlen sequence whose base type embeds an address (nested vlen or
//! reference); virtual and external data layouts; a lossy filter on the
//! contiguous re-encode or sparse-chunked fallback path; an attribute whose
//! datatype is or contains a reference (its stored address is not rewritten yet,
//! and no [`AttrValue`] can re-encode it); and a use of a committed datatype the
//! repack drops or that no hard link reaches. An object that cannot be
//! reproduced fails the repack by name rather than being silently dropped.
//!
//! One thing is resolved rather than reproduced: a *shared dataspace*, which
//! only a file with a shared-message (SOHM) table has, is written back inline.
//! Unlike a datatype, a dataspace has no name and no HDF5 call reports one as
//! shared, so there is nothing an inline copy loses. (In practice such a file is
//! refused earlier: reading a SOHM-stored message is not supported.)
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! Repack is **out-of-core** (issue [#82]): it opens the source with
//! [`File::open_streaming`], reading metadata and one working chunk on demand
//! rather than buffering the whole file, copies each chunked dataset's
//! compressed chunks verbatim one at a time, and streams the output straight to
//! the destination. Peak memory is therefore bounded by a single chunk plus the
//! file's metadata, independent of dataset (or file) size, so a file whose data
//! exceeds available RAM repacks successfully.
//!
