//! File-creation properties as one reusable value — the `fcpl` analogue.

use crate::file_space_info::FileSpaceStrategy;
use crate::libver::LibVer;

/// File-creation properties applied when writing a new HDF5 file.
///
/// This is the `hdf5-pure` analogue of an HDF5 **file creation property list**
/// (`fcpl`): one value carrying every creation-time setting, so application code
/// can define a file layout once and reuse it everywhere it writes, instead of
/// repeating a builder call chain and keeping the copies in sync.
///
/// The `Properties` suffix means the type stands in for one whole HDF5 property
/// list, so every setting on it has a C counterpart to look up. It is a stand-in
/// and not a port: a plain `Copy` value, with no handle to create or close, no
/// runtime property registry, and no setter that can fail. `fcpl` and each
/// `H5Pset_*` it models are doc aliases, so a search for either lands here.
///
/// One setting crosses the class line. `H5Pset_libver_bounds` is officially a
/// *file access* property, but this crate checks the bound as the file is
/// written, so [`with_libver_bounds`](Self::with_libver_bounds) lives here with
/// the other write-time settings rather than on
/// [`FileAccessProperties`](crate::FileAccessProperties).
///
/// Pass it to [`FileBuilder::with_create_properties`](crate::FileBuilder::with_create_properties)
/// or [`File::create_with_options`](crate::File::create_with_options). The
/// equivalent [`FileBuilder`](crate::FileBuilder) methods set the same fields one
/// at a time and interoperate freely with this.
///
/// Values are recorded as given and checked when the file is written, not when
/// the properties are built — the value is inert data, so an illegal page size
/// is reported by `finish`/`write` rather than here. Note that a non-paged
/// userblock size is currently **not** validated against HDF5's power-of-two
/// rule; see the property-support reference for the exact coverage.
///
/// See the [property-support reference] for the full property-by-property map.
///

/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// use hdf5_pure::{FileCreateProperties, FileSpaceStrategy};

/// // Define the layout once...
/// fn paged_layout() -> FileCreateProperties {
///     FileCreateProperties::new()
///         .with_file_space_strategy(FileSpaceStrategy::Page, true, 1)
///         .with_file_space_page_size(8192)

/// // ...and reuse it across every write path.
