//! Planning and emitting the *managed* blocks of a dense-attribute fractal heap.
//!
//! A fractal heap's managed space is a doubling table: a row of [`TABLE_WIDTH`]
//! blocks of [`STARTING_BLOCK_SIZE`], a second row of the same size, and then a
//! row at each successive power of two up to [`MAX_DIRECT_BLOCK_SIZE`]. Rows past
//! that hold *indirect* blocks, each of which is a doubling table in turn, so the
//! heap's address space tiles exactly and grows without any block growing past
//! 64 KiB.
//!
//! This module plans that layout for a list of object sizes and then serializes
//! it. Planning and serializing are separate because the addresses of everything
//! downstream of the heap depend on how many blocks it needs, which is only known
//! once the objects have been placed.
//!
//! The geometry constants are the reference C library's own attribute-heap
//! parameters: the `H5O_FHEAP_MAN_*` macros in `H5Oprivate.h`, which
//! `H5A__dense_create` passes to `H5HF_create`. A heap emitted here therefore has
//! the shape one the C library builds. (The similarly named `H5G_FHEAP_MAN_*` in
//! `H5Gdense.c` are the *group* heap's parameters and differ in two of them; they
//! are not the ones to copy.) [`crate::fractal_heap`] reads the same geometry back
//! out of the header and derives the direct/indirect row boundary with the same
//! formula, so the two cannot disagree about where a block sits.
