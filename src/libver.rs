//! Library-version bounds — the [`H5F_libver_t`] concept.
//!
//! Every HDF5 file is encoded with a set of *format versions* (superblock,
//! object headers, message encodings). A reader needs a library new enough to
//! understand those versions, and the HDF5 C API lets a writer bound which
//! versions a new file may use via `H5Pset_libver_bounds`. [`LibVer`] names the
//! release boundaries at which the on-disk format changed, so callers of this
//! crate can ask which format an existing file requires
//! ([`crate::File::libver_bound`]) or constrain what a new file may emit
//! ([`crate::FileBuilder::with_libver_bounds`]).
//!
//! [`H5F_libver_t`]: https://portal.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/group___f_a_p_l.html

/// A library-version boundary, mirroring HDF5's `H5F_libver_t`.
///
/// Variants are ordered oldest to newest; a later variant understands strictly
/// more of the format than an earlier one. `LibVer` derives `Ord` on that
/// ordering, so bounds can be compared directly.
///
/// Non-exhaustive: the reference library keeps adding boundaries as the format
/// grows, so match with a `_` arm and read the newest this crate knows about
/// from [`LATEST`](Self::LATEST).
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)]
