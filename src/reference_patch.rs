//! Repointing the object references a file already stores, across the
//! object-header relocations one commit makes (issue #324).
//!
//! A [`File::open_rw`](crate::File::open_rw) commit rebuilds a dirty object's
//! header at a fresh address and repoints the one *link* that names it. That is
//! enough for the link graph and not enough for the file: an **object
//! reference** is an object-header address stored as data, in a dataset's
//! elements or an attribute's value, and nothing about rewriting a header
//! updates one. Left alone it keeps naming the pre-commit header, which the same
//! commit frees — so a reference dataset the commit never touched reads a stale
//! copy of the object, and reads garbage once something reuses the span.
//!
//! This module finds those stored addresses and rewrites them. It runs *after*
//! the superblock repoint, over the committed tree, for two reasons. The commit
//! is atomic at the repoint, and a fixup derived from it must not precede it: a
//! crash before the repoint has to leave the pre-commit file, references
//! included. And the committed tree is the one whose bytes need fixing — a
//! rebuilt group's header is a fresh copy of the pre-commit one, carrying the
//! old address of anything it referenced, so patching the header the commit
//! superseded would correct bytes that are already dead.
//!
//! # What it reaches
//!
//! Two questions decide it, and both have to answer yes: **where** the bytes are
//! stored, and **what** [`embedded_reference_slots`] can locate inside an
//! element.
//!
//! Storage: an **inline attribute's value**, and a **contiguous** or **compact**
//! dataset's elements. A **committed** (`H5Tcommit`) datatype is followed rather
//! than skipped, so a dataset of references through a named type is reached like
//! any other.
//!
//! Datatype: an 8-byte object reference, an **array** of them, a **compound**
//! holding one, and any nesting of those two. That is the whole of it — see
//! `datatype::embedded_reference_slots`, whose reach this inherits exactly.
//!
//! # What it does not
//!
//! Everything else, and none of it is refused. Each is left as it was, which is
//! the pre-#324 behaviour rather than a new failure. By storage:
//!
//! - **Chunked** dataset elements. Unfiltered chunks would only need the index
//!   walked; filtered ones hold their addresses compressed, the same obstacle
//!   that makes [`crate::repack`] refuse a chunked object-reference dataset.
//! - **Dense (fractal-heap) attributes**, whose values are not in the header,
//!   and an attribute held as a **shared (SOHM) record**, which is not stored in
//!   the header either.
//! - An **attribute's value** in a **version 1 object header** — the one
//!   [`read_oh_chunks`] declines on a well-formed file (it declines a malformed
//!   one too). Such an object's *element data* is still reached, through the
//!   parsed form that reads both versions ([`scan_parsed_header`]); what that
//!   form does not hand back is the file offset an attribute inside the header
//!   would have to be written at. Nor does it hide the objects below it: it is
//!   descended through either way.
//!
//! And by datatype, every form `embedded_reference_slots` answers `None` for: an
//! object reference **wider than 8 bytes**, a **dataset-region** reference, a
//! **variable length** of references (the encoding the dimension-scale attribute
//! `DIMENSION_LIST` uses, whose addresses sit in a global heap collection), an
//! **enumeration** over one, and any compound or array reaching one of those.
//!
//! A file whose objects all carry version 1 headers — the reference C library's
//! default, and h5py's — can never be *proved* free of references, since an
//! attribute in one of those headers is never read. Such a file is therefore
//! walked on every commit rather than on the first.
//!
//! Deliberately, none of these is a *refusal*. Every commit rebuilds at least
//! its root group, so there is always a relocation in hand, and refusing on an
//! unreachable shape would therefore refuse *every* commit on any file holding
//! one — a ban rather than a check, imposed on files whose references were no
//! better served before this module existed. `docs/reference/limitations.md`
//! records the set as a whole.
