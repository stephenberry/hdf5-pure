//! HDF5 Shared Object Header Message resolution.
//!
//! A header message whose record has the shared flag (bit 1 of `msg_flags`) set
//! does not hold its own content. Its body is a *reference* to the one copy of
//! that message stored elsewhere, and the same reference encoding appears inside
//! an attribute message whose datatype or dataspace field is shared.
//!
//! Two things can be on the other end of a reference:
//!
//! - another **object header**, which is what `H5Tcommit` writes for a named
//!   ("committed") datatype — resolved here;
//! - the file's **shared object header message (SOHM) heap**, a fractal heap this
//!   reader does not walk — refused by name rather than mis-read.
//!
//! The layouts and the type codes below follow `H5O__shared_decode` in the C
//! library, which is the authority on what a file may contain: version 1 carries
//! a symbol-table entry (so its object-header address sits past a local-heap
//! address), version 2 and 3 carry the address or heap id directly, and the type
//! byte distinguishes the two destinations only from version 2 on.
