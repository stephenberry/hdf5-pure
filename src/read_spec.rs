//! The per-dataset properties every raw read is performed against.
//!
//! Reading a dataset's element bytes takes five facts about the dataset — where
//! its storage is, what shape it has, what an element is, what filters its bytes
//! passed through, and what unallocated storage reads as — and the call chain
//! that does it is four layers deep: the reader picks a backend, `data_read`
//! dispatches on the layout, `chunked_read` walks the chunk index, and the
//! assembly kernel places what it decoded. Every layer needs all five, so before
//! this type they were threaded through as five positional parameters and the
//! signatures reached twelve arguments.
//!
//! The cost of that shape was not the width; it was that adding a property meant
//! editing roughly thirty call sites, several of them mechanically across test
//! fixtures, where a default inserted in place of a real value compiles and
//! passes (issue #294). A property added to [`RawReadSpec`] instead reaches every
//! layer at once, and the sites that must decide what it is are the few that
//! build the spec.
