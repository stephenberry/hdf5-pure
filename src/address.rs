//! The superblock base address, as a type distinct from the addresses it shifts.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The format specification says of the superblock's base address that "unless
//! otherwise noted, all other file addresses are relative to this base address".
//! A userblock makes that base non-zero — 512 bytes for every `.mat` file this
//! crate writes — so an HDF5 file holds addresses in *two* frames at once:
//!
//! * a **stored** address, as written in metadata, relative to the base;
//! * an **absolute** byte position in the file, which is what a
//!   [`Source`](crate::source::Source) reads at.
//!
//! Both are `u64`, both are usually equal (a plain file has a base of zero), and
//! the compiler has nothing to say about mixing them. The result is a defect
//! class rather than a defect: a reader that forgets the base lands inside the
//! userblock, and every test written against a base-0 file passes anyway.
//! `tests/userblock_base_address_crosscheck.rs` was written after that happened
//! three separate times — dense attributes, object header continuations, and
//! dense link storage — and it covers the ground its four rows name, which is
//! not the same as covering the ground.
//!
//! [`BaseAddress`] does not make the two frames distinct types; addresses stay
//! `u64` throughout the crate. What it makes distinct is the **base itself**,
//! which is the operand every one of those defects got wrong. That buys three
//! things a bare `u64` did not give:
//!
//! * A base cannot be passed where an address is expected, or an address where a
//!   base is expected. Both directions were previously a silent argument swap in
//!   functions that take `(address, ..., base_address)` — the shape of nearly
//!   every parser in this crate.
//! * Both conversions are **checked, and named**: 46 call sites of
//!   [`BaseAddress::absolute`] and 18 of [`BaseAddress::relative`], plus their
//!   test fixtures. Most replaced a hand-written `checked_add(base)` chain, but
//!   **seven unchecked additions and eighteen unchecked subtractions** were in
//!   that set, each of which panics in a debug build and wraps in a release one.
//!   Two were the `stored_addr + base` in [`group_v2`](crate::group_v2)'s two
//!   path resolvers, now the single [`ChildLookup::of`](crate::group_v2::ChildLookup)
//!   that both share; `a_link_target_that_overflows_the_base_address_is_refused`
//!   covers it. The rest are in the write engine, where an absolute address goes
//!   back to stored form on the way into a link message or a superblock. Three
//!   additions of a base survive unconverted, all inside `debug_assert_eq!` in
//!   [`file_writer`](crate::file_writer), whose bodies a release build does not
//!   compile.
//! * "This code does not need the base" becomes [`BaseAddress::ZERO`]. Five call
//!   sites in the crate's code paths make that claim, so a `grep` finds all five
//!   — where a literal `0` argument was indistinguishable from the other zeroes
//!   on the line. (Another 34 are test fixtures satisfying a signature with a
//!   base they do not care about.)
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! The read path resolves the two frames two different ways, and this type is
//! neutral between them. Object headers and group entries add the base to each
//! address as they parse it ([`absolute`](BaseAddress::absolute)); raw data,
//! chunk indices, and dense attribute storage instead *frame the file* at the
//! base — [`frame`](crate::source::frame) for a buffer,
//! [`BaseOffsetSource`](crate::source::BaseOffsetSource) for a stream — and read
//! stored addresses against that shifted view directly. Both are correct, and
//! which one a given parser is owed is a fact about the parser, not about the
//! base. A newtype for stored-versus-absolute *addresses* would encode that too;
//! it would also have to propagate through every chunk address, free-space
//! section, and index element in the crate, which is a far larger change than
//! this one and is not attempted here.
