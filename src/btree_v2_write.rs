//! HDF5 B-tree v2 emission.
//!
//! The counterpart to [`btree_v2`](crate::btree_v2): given records already in
//! the tree's sort order, lay out a balanced tree of fixed-size nodes and
//! serialize it.
//!
//! Trees are built bottom-up in one pass rather than by repeated insertion.
//! Every node is exactly `node_size` bytes, so a node's address is its index
//! times that size, and a parent can be serialized as soon as its children have
//! been placed. The result is the same *shape* the reference C library reaches
//! by inserting records one at a time — balanced, all leaves at one depth, no
//! node over capacity — without reproducing its split-and-promote machinery.
//!
//! Node capacities come from [`NodeInfo`], the table
//! [`btree_v2`](crate::btree_v2) already computes to decode a tree's
//! variable-width child pointers, so an emitted tree cannot declare a geometry
//! this crate would then read it back with differently.
