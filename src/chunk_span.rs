//! Reading a run of adjacent chunks in one call, for the streaming readers.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The streaming chunked readers fetch one chunk per [`Source::read_exact_at`],
//! which is one `seek` plus one `read` each. That is right for the
//! megabyte-sized chunks a file written in one pass carries, and wrong for a
//! file written as the data arrived: a recorder that appends a row at a time
//! produces one chunk per row, so a recording of 73 datasets over 280 rows
//! holds 20,440 chunks of a few dozen bytes. Reading one chunk at a time cost
//! about four times what the same read costs from a buffered
//! [`crate::File::open`], and the whole difference was read *granularity* — the
//! file was read exactly once, in 32-byte pieces.
//!
//! Those chunks are adjacent on disk. libhdf5 allocates a chunk when its chunk
//! cache flushes rather than when the write is issued, so even a writer filling
//! 73 datasets a row at a time lays each dataset's chunks down in one run, and
//! this crate's writer does the same. A reader that asks for the run in one
//! call gets the same bytes in 73 reads instead of 20,440, which brings the
//! streaming read within about 15% of the buffered one.
//!
//! # What it does not spend
//!
//! **Memory.** A span stops at [`MAX_SPAN_BYTES`], so what a reader holds
//! beyond the caller's own buffers is bounded by that however large the dataset
//! is. `open_streaming` exists so that a file larger than memory still opens,
//! and this must not spend that. The one span that may exceed the cap is a
//! single chunk larger than it, which is read alone — exactly the read the
//! direct path would have issued.
//!
//! **Read volume.** Only chunks that are exactly adjacent merge, so a span
//! covers nothing but the chunks it was planned over. Bridging a gap between
//! two nearby chunks would trade read count for read volume; on the layouts
//! this targets there is no gap to bridge. It follows that the caller must plan
//! over the chunks it will actually fetch, not over every chunk of the dataset:
//! a chunk the caller will skip — outside a row window, or already in the chunk
//! cache — leaves a hole that a span would cover and read for nothing.
//!
//! # What the caller owes it
//!
//! Chunks must be *asked for* in address order. A reader holds one span, so a
//! walk that alternates between two spans re-reads a whole span at each
//! alternation; the chunk index yields index order and a cached index yields no
//! order at all, so neither is safe to walk unsorted. Serving out of order
//! stays correct — [`chunk_bytes`](ChunkSpanReader::chunk_bytes) re-reads
//! whatever span it needs — but it gives up the read count that is the point.
