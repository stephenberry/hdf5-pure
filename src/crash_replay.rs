//! Replay every prefix of what reached the disk, and read what it left.
//!
//! # The defect class this exists for
//!
//! Since the write gathering of issue #288, the writes an operation makes
//! between two ordering barriers are issued in **address order** rather than in
//! the order the engine made them. In this format that is systematically the
//! wrong way round: every publish point sits at a *lower* address than the
//! content it names — the superblock at address 0, an object header's dataspace
//! dimension and Extensible-Array element count near the front of the file, the
//! chunk bytes and index blocks they name at end-of-file. So an
//! append-then-publish pair with no barrier between them now publishes *first*.
//!
//! The resulting failure is the bad kind. A pointer that survives while the
//! block it names does not is a checksummed, valid-looking address into bytes
//! past end-of-file, and the *next* append believes the block exists and writes
//! into nothing.
//!
//! What holds this together is [`FileImage::ordering_barrier`], and a missing one
//! is invisible to every ordinary test: the operation completes, the file is
//! correct, and only a machine that stops at the wrong instant can tell. This
//! module is what stops the machine at every instant.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! [`disk_log`] records each write and each `set_len` that a session actually
//! issued. A [`Recording`] pairs that log with the file's bytes as they were
//! before the session opened, which makes every prefix of the log a file that
//! could really have existed: the operations are positioned, so applying the
//! first *k* of them to the starting bytes is exactly the disk state after *k* of
//! them completed. Each prefix is written out and read back, and judged as
//! [`Verdict::Clean`], [`Verdict::Loud`] or [`Verdict::Silent`].
//!
//! # This one can fail
//!
//! A crash harness that cannot fail is decoration, and the first draft of this
//! one was: it swept five hundred prefixes, called every one of them clean, and
//! went on doing so with **both** of the ordering barriers it was written for
//! deleted. Nothing about that was visible from the outside — the sweep was wide,
//! the assertions were real, and the numbers looked healthy.
//!
//! Three separate things were wrong, and the fix for each is a *demand the code
//! makes* rather than a value that happens to be right:
//!
//! 1. The window did not cross the allocations that reach the barriers — see
//!    [`WARMUP_ROUNDS`] and [`Recording::assert_positioned`].
//! 2. The file was small enough that a publish point and the content it names
//!    merged into a single write, which is atomic — see [`CHUNK`] and the same
//!    method's second condition.
//! 3. A prefix that refused to read was counted as benign — see
//!    [`Tally::assert_sound`].
//!
//! Each of those is now something a future change trips over rather than
//! silently loses. [`Recording::replay_every_prefix`] adds two more of the same
//! kind: replaying the *whole* log must reproduce the file the session really
//! left, so a write escaping [`disk_log`] cannot pass unnoticed, and the last
//! prefix must satisfy the workload's finished state, so a session that quietly
//! stopped doing work cannot either.
//!
//! # What it covers, and what it does not
//!
//! Measured by deleting each barrier in the Extensible-Array append engine in
//! turn and running the library:
//!
//! | barrier | caught |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | before a fresh data-block pointer | yes, and by the pre-existing structural test |
//! | before a fresh super-block pointer | yes, only by [`a_crashed_append_can_be_reopened_and_appended_to`] |
//! | `apply_ea_append` phase 1, chunk bytes → superblock end-of-file | yes, by [`recorded_eof_covers_the_file`] |
//! | `apply_ea_append` phase 1, end-of-file → index writes | **no** |
//! | `apply_ea_append` phase 2 → 3 | **no** |
//! | `apply_ea_append` phase 3, header count → dimension | yes |
//!
//! A barrier is not the only way this class of defect arrives. A *publish* is
//! the other: a value written apart from the checksum covering it is two writes
//! with a crash point between them, no matter how the barriers fall. That was
//! issue #307, and it is why the sweeps here are run at more than one header
//! width — see [`warmed_base_padded`] and
//! [`a_publish_costs_the_same_whether_or_not_it_spans_a_page`].
//!
//! The two uncovered ones are not gaps in the sweep, and it is worth knowing why
//! before adding a workload to chase them. Deleting the first changes **nothing
//! that reaches the disk** under gathering — the recorded write order is
//! byte-identical, because the order it enforces is the order address-sorting
//! already produces. Deleting the second does reorder two metadata writes, but
//! the state between them is a published element count with a stale block, which
//! is indistinguishable from a normal in-progress append to a reader bounded by
//! the dataspace dimension. Both remain load-bearing for the two things this
//! module does not model: `fsync` durability under
//! [`SyncPolicy::Always`](crate::SyncPolicy), and the visibility order a *SWMR*
//! reader follows, which is defined in terms of the header counts rather than the
//! dimension.
//!
//! Outside this engine, nothing is covered: dense attribute heaps, the
//! Fixed-Array and v2 B-tree chunk indexes, filtered and variable-length chunk
//! writes, and group link-table growth all publish low-address pointers to
//! high-address content and have no sweep here. That is the remaining half of
//! issue #309.
