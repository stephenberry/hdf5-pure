//! Where a chunk sits in a chunk index, and what sits at a given slot.
//!
//! A Fixed Array and an Extensible Array both store their elements *positionally*:
//! an element carries a chunk's address (and, when filtered, its stored size and
//! filter mask) but never its coordinates. The slot number is the coordinates.
//! Getting that numbering wrong therefore produces a file that decodes perfectly
//! and resolves its data to the wrong addresses — which is why this rule lives in
//! one place that the writer and both readers call, rather than being restated on
//! each side (issue #299).
//!
//! Two things about the numbering are easy to get wrong, and this crate had both:
//!
//! * It is taken over the dataset's **maximum** chunk grid, not its current one.
//!   A dataset of shape `[3, 3]` with `[2, 2]` chunks holds four chunks either
//!   way, but declaring `maxshape [3, 8]` widens the grid to 2x4 and moves the
//!   two bottom chunks from slots 2 and 3 to slots 4 and 5.
//! * An Extensible Array rotates its unlimited dimension to the front first
//!   (`H5VM_swizzle_coords`), so that the one dimension free to grow is the
//!   slowest-varying and a new row of chunks lands past every existing slot
//!   rather than interleaved among them. With the unlimited dimension already
//!   first the rotation is the identity, which is why one-dimensional and
//!   grow-down-the-rows datasets were unaffected.
//!
//! The grid's own dimension counts come from the maximum extent, so an unlimited
//! dimension has no count at all. That is not a problem to work around: after the
//! rotation the unbounded dimension is the outermost one, and an outermost
//! dimension's extent never enters any multiplier.
