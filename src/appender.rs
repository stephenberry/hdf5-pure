//! A write-side chunk buffer for appends ([`BufferedAppender`]).
//!
//! [`Dataset::append`](crate::Dataset::append) writes on every call: it encodes
//! the appended elements, places the chunks they land in, extends the chunk
//! index, and fsyncs five times so a power loss leaves either the old length or
//! the new one. That is the right trade for a caller appending a chunk at a
//! time, and the wrong one for a caller appending a hundred elements at a time
//! into a chunk that holds a thousand — which pays the whole sequence ten times
//! over to write one chunk, and cannot pay it at all when the dataset is
//! filtered, because a filtered trailing chunk cannot be grown in place.
//!
//! A [`BufferedAppender`] holds appended elements in memory and writes them
//! only when they complete a chunk, so the file sees one append per chunk
//! rather than one per call. It is this crate's equivalent of the reference C
//! library's raw-data chunk cache, and it carries the same bargain: buffered
//! elements are not in the file until [`flush`](BufferedAppender::flush) or
//! [`finish`](BufferedAppender::finish) puts them there.

/// Buffers appended elements and writes them a whole chunk at a time.
///
/// Obtained from [`Dataset::buffered_appender`]. The dataset must be one
/// [`Dataset::append`] accepts — chunked, rank-1, unlimited along axis 0, and
/// Extensible-Array indexed — and that eligibility, along with the refusal of a
/// SWMR session (which cannot write a partial trailing chunk at all), is
/// reported when the appender is constructed rather than on the first write.
///
/// The appender borrows the [`Dataset`] for its lifetime, so that handle cannot
/// be read while it is alive; open a second handle off the same [`File`](crate::File) to read
/// the written prefix as it grows. That borrow is what lets the appender re-read
/// the dataset's length from the session before every write instead of trusting
/// a cached one.
///
/// # What it costs
///
/// Every [`append`](Self::append) that does not complete a chunk is a memory
/// copy and nothing else. When one or more chunks are complete, exactly those
/// chunks are written through the immediate, crash-atomic in-place path, and
/// the remainder stays buffered. So a caller appending `k` elements at a time
/// into a chunk of `n` performs one file write per `n/k` calls instead of one
/// per call, and a *filtered* dataset — which [`Dataset::append`] refuses to
/// grow by a partial chunk at all — is appended by any length.
///
/// # Durability
///
/// Buffered elements are not in the file. Each write the appender does make is
/// itself crash-atomic, so a crash loses the buffered tail and never the file:
/// the dataset reads back as the prefix that was written. That holds against
/// power loss under the default [`SyncPolicy`](crate::SyncPolicy) and against a
/// process crash under either — see [`SyncPolicy::OnClose`](crate::SyncPolicy::OnClose). [`flush`](Self::flush)
/// writes the buffered tail immediately, and [`finish`](Self::finish) flushes
/// and consumes the appender.
///
/// Dropping without either still flushes, but a `Drop` has nowhere to return an
/// error, so prefer [`finish`](Self::finish) where the error matters — or
/// [`flush`](Self::flush), which keeps the appender and therefore keeps
/// [`unwritten`](Self::unwritten) reachable.
///
/// # Why staged edits are refused around it
///
/// An appender holds elements the caller has already been told were accepted,
/// and only its own flush can write them. The immediate append path refuses a
/// dataset that has a staged edit on it or an ancestor, so staging one while an
/// appender is live would turn accepted data into data lost silently at drop
/// time. The session therefore refuses that edit at the call that makes it,
/// with [`Error::EditUnsupported`](crate::Error::EditUnsupported), for as long
/// as the appender is alive:
///
/// - an edit naming this dataset or an ancestor —
///   [`Group::create_dataset`](crate::Group::create_dataset),
///   [`Dataset::set_attr`](crate::Dataset::set_attr),
///   [`Group::delete`](crate::Group::delete), [`File::copy`](crate::File::copy)
///   and the rest;
/// - *every* staged edit while the appender still owes the realignment described
///   below, since that write commits and a commit will not run beside unrelated
///   staged edits;
/// - a second appender on the same dataset, which would interleave the two
///   buffers a chunk at a time.
///
/// Each of those is reported to the caller who created the conflict, which is
/// the only place it can be acted on. What remains outside that guarantee is
/// closing the file — [`File::close`](crate::File::close) does not flush live
/// appenders — and a buffer left ending mid-element, which only
/// [`append_raw`](Self::append_raw) can produce.
///
/// # The one expensive case
///
/// A *filtered* dataset whose on-disk length is not a whole multiple of its
/// chunk length has a partial trailing chunk, and growing that chunk in place
/// would repoint an index element a reader can already see — a multi-field
/// record whose overwrite is not power-loss atomic. The appender instead lands
/// such a dataset back on a chunk boundary with one staged, index-rebuilding
/// commit ([`Dataset::append_staged`]), and every write after that is the cheap
/// in-place one. A log resumed across sessions therefore pays that commit once
/// when it is opened, not once per append.
///
/// Because that recovery commits, it is refused while the session holds
/// unrelated staged edits; commit or discard those first.
