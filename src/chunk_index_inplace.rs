//! In-place Extensible-Array chunk-index growth, driven by the edit engine
//! ([`crate::edit`]) over whichever image the session holds — the machinery
//! behind [`Dataset::append`](crate::Dataset::append) and
//! [`File::open_swmr_writer`](crate::File::open_swmr_writer).
//!
//! It grows a one-dimensional, unlimited, Extensible-Array-indexed
//! dataset *in place*: a new chunk is written at end-of-file or into freed space,
//! its record is
//! stored into an element slot of the chunk index, the index grows by appending
//! new blocks only when a block boundary is crossed (never relocating existing
//! data), and the dataspace dimension and array-header counts are patched. Writes
//! land child-before-parent so a crash (and, for SWMR, a concurrent reader) only
//! ever observes a consistent prefix, with the dataspace dimension published last
//! as the single commit point. The *order* is what a concurrent reader depends
//! on; the `fsync` barriers between the steps carry that order across power loss,
//! and a session under [`SyncPolicy::OnClose`](crate::SyncPolicy) skips them
//! without changing it, taking one barrier at teardown instead.
//!
//! This module owns the byte-level mechanics that do not depend on *why* the
//! append is happening: the writable byte seam ([`Store`]), the per-dataset
//! geometry cache ([`Located`]), and the element-slot / block / super-block
//! writes that maintain the Extensible Array. It is element-width
//! agnostic: the same code path stores a bare address for an unfiltered array
//! (client id 0) or the full `address + compressed_size + filter_mask` record for
//! a filtered array (client id 1), selected by the array header's client id. The
//! callers layer their own policy on top: SWMR sets the superblock consistency
//! flag and refuses filters; the general writer takes an exclusive lock, accepts
//! filters, and relocates a partial trailing chunk.
