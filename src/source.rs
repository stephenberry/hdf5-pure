//! Random-access byte sources for the reader: the [`Source`] trait and its
//! backends.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Today the reader holds the **entire file** in one `Vec<u8>` ([`crate::File`])
//! and threads a `&[u8]` of that whole buffer through every parser, indexing it
//! by absolute offset. That is simple and fast, but it has a hard ceiling: a
//! file larger than the process address space cannot be loaded at all. On a
//! 32-bit host (`usize` is 32 bits, ~4 GiB of usable address space) a 20 GiB
//! HDF5 file produced on a 64-bit machine simply cannot be `read()` into a
//! `Vec`, no matter how carefully offsets are converted (see [`crate::convert`],
//! which makes the *narrowing* safe but cannot conjure address space). This is
//! the core of issue #27.
//!
//! HDF5 metadata (superblock, object headers, B-trees, heaps) is tiny relative
//! to the dataset payload, and the format is designed for random access by
//! absolute file offset. So the durable fix is to read **on demand** from a
//! seekable source instead of materializing the whole file: keep only a small
//! working set (the metadata being parsed, plus the data chunks currently being
//! decompressed) resident at any time.
//!
//! [`Source`] is that abstraction. It is deliberately minimal and
//! `no_std`/`alloc`-friendly (the trait and the in-memory backends need no
//! `std`), so it works on the same constrained targets the rest of the crate
//! supports.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! - [`BytesSource`] — wraps any owned-or-borrowed byte buffer (`Vec<u8>`,
//!   `&[u8]`, `Box<[u8]>`, `Arc<[u8]>`, …). This is the in-memory model the
//!   current [`crate::File`] uses; it is always available, including on WASM and
//!   `no_std`.
//! - [`ReadSeekSource`] (`std` only) — wraps any `Read + Seek` (a
//!   [`std::fs::File`], a `Cursor`, etc.) and reads bytes lazily via
//!   `seek` + `read`. This is the backend that lets a 32-bit host read a file
//!   far larger than its address space, because it never holds more than the
//!   bytes a single `read_at` requests.
//!
//! A windowed `mmap` backend (an optional, `std`-plus-OS feature pulling a crate
//! like `memmap2`) is a natural future addition behind this same trait. Note
//! that a *whole-file* mmap does **not** solve the 32-bit problem — mapping
//! 20 GiB still needs 20 GiB of virtual address space — so only a *windowed*
//! mmap (map/unmap sub-ranges) or plain `Read + Seek` works there. It is left
//! out for now rather than adding a dependency speculatively.
//!
//! # How the reader uses this (issue #27)
//!
//! The staged migration this module was built for has landed far enough to
//! carry a streaming reader: the data readers fetch each chunk through
//! [`Source::read_at`] rather than slicing a whole-file buffer, and
//! [`crate::File::open_streaming`] constructs a file backed by a
//! [`ReadSeekSource`], so opening one no longer implies buffering it.
//!
//! The metadata parsers are the part that is only half done. Each one that a
//! streaming read reaches has a `*_from_source` twin that reads its bounded
//! structure into a small buffer on demand, but the whole-file `&[u8]` form
//! remains beside it for the buffered path — `ObjectHeader::parse` next to
//! `parse_from_source`, and the same shape in `btree_v1` and `superblock`. The
//! two are what the duplication survey counted as 47 twins; collapsing them is
//! separate work from this module.
//!
//! One piece of the original plan arrived in a different shape. It called for a
//! `Cursor<'a>` over a `&'a dyn Source` to absorb the `read_offset` /
//! `read_length` idioms and collapse the duplicated per-module copies of them.
//! What those copies had in common turned out to be the *decoding*, not the
//! fetching: a parser reads its structure into a buffer first, and then every
//! module was reading little-endian fields out of that buffer the same way. So
//! the collapse is [`crate::bytes`], which operates on the buffer, and a cursor
//! over the source itself was not needed to get it.
