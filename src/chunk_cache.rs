/// 16 slots, 2,032 of them evicted by the same read that stored them, an
/// allocator round trip each and, on the unfiltered path, a copy of the chunk as
/// well (issue #228).

/// So a pass fills the cache and then stops offering, and what it leaves behind
/// is the chunks it reached first rather than the ones it reached last.
///
/// # Which half is worth keeping is the caller's question, not this type's
///
/// That last sentence is the whole trade, and it does not go the same way for
/// every read. Keeping the *tail* is only possible by offering every chunk and
/// evicting, which is the cost this exists to remove — so a read that wants the
/// tail asks for [`CachePass::LRU`] and pays for it.
///
/// A read of a whole dataset does not want it: a caller who reads it again
/// starts at the beginning, so a retained prefix is worth at least as much as a
/// retained suffix, and it costs a fraction as much to keep. A *lone* row window
/// does want it, because its successor is the adjacent window and the chunk they
/// share is the one this read finished on — which is why
/// [`Dataset::read_raw_rows`](crate::Dataset::read_raw_rows) asks for `LRU` while
/// the two whole-dataset loops open a real pass.
///
/// The windowed reader itself takes the pass from its caller rather than
/// choosing, because the same window means different things to different
/// callers: a sweep of a whole dataset in windows opens one real pass for all of
/// them, since it asks for each chunk exactly once and has no more use for the
/// last window's chunks than for the first's.
///
/// # Being served a chunk claims it, too
///
/// The same reasoning reaches one step further than placing a chunk does. A pass
/// owns any slot it has been *served* from as well as any it filled, because a
/// chunk this read has already used is worth at least as much as one it has not
/// reached yet — and giving it back buys the same nothing.
///
/// Left out, that cost a repeat read everything the previous read had saved for
/// it. A second read of a dataset larger than the cache hit all `max_slots`
/// retained chunks, then handed every one of them back on its next `max_slots`
/// misses, so the third read hit nothing and the count alternated `max_slots`,
/// 0, `max_slots`, 0 forever — half the available hit rate, plus a placement and
/// an eviction per chunk to arrive at a set the next read would destroy.
///
/// This is narrower than refusing to touch an earlier pass's chunks at all,
