///   buffer.
/// - The chunk cache (`H5Pset_cache`) is the file-wide default for datasets
///   opened from any backend, overridable per dataset with
///   [`DatasetAccessProperties`].
/// - The locking policy (`H5Pset_file_locking`) applies to the read-write opens.
///   Readers and the SWMR writer take no lock by design, so they ignore it.
/// - The write-mark policy applies to the read-only opens, and has no C

    /// budget's worth of it. Writes issued on a 4 KiB-paged file:
    ///
    /// | workload | unset | 4 KiB | 64 KiB | 1 MiB |
    /// | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    /// | 32 chunk appends into 8 datasets, then a commit | 188 | 25 | 4 | 4 |
    /// | one 4 MiB append | 131 | 1,094 | 74 | 10 |
    ///
    /// On the scattered workload this property exists for, a small budget costs
    /// little; on the long run 64 KiB is seven times the writes of 1 MiB.
    ///
    /// The memory comparison against leaving this unset is not the one the table
    /// suggests. A session that sets nothing already gathers up to 1 MiB of dirty
    /// bytes **per operation**, and releases it at every ordering barrier; a page
    /// buffer holds its budget **across** operations, until the budget is spent,
    /// an `fsync`, or [`File::close`]. So 1 MiB here trades a per-operation peak
    /// for a continuous residency of the same size, and a budget below 1 MiB
    /// lowers both.
    ///
    /// # How this differs from `H5Pset_page_buffer_size`
    ///
    /// **A paged file is not required, where the C library requires one.**
    /// `H5PB_create` refuses an unpaged file because the C page buffer is a page
    /// *cache*, and its `min_meta_perc` / `min_raw_perc` reservations are counted
    /// in pages that the paged allocator keeps segregated by kind. This is a
    /// write gatherer: it merges runs within a page-sized window and flushes
    /// whole, so a window is all it needs, and an unpaged file gets the same
    /// 4 KiB one that every read-write session already gathers under. Since
    /// unpaged is the default strategy, requiring `Page` put this property out of
    /// reach of most files for no reason this implementation had.
    ///
    /// **A small budget costs writes here, where it costs none in C.**
