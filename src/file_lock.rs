//! The two guards that decide who may open a file: OS advisory locking for the
//! in-place editor (issue #73), and the superblock's durable status-flags byte
//! (issue #245).
//!
//! Locking is the crash-safe half of HDF5's concurrency model and the `hdf5-pure`
//! analogue of `H5Pset_file_locking` / the `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING` environment
//! variable. It is deliberately distinct from the *superblock consistency flag*
//! (the durable `status_flags` byte a SWMR writer sets; see [`crate::File::open_swmr_writer`]):
//!
//! - An **OS lock** is owned by the kernel and tied to the open file. It is
//!   released automatically when the process exits *for any reason* — clean exit,
//!   panic, `SIGKILL`, even power loss — so it never leaves stale state and is
//!   the authoritative signal for "a writer is alive *right now*".
//! - The **on-disk flag** is just a byte; only userspace code at clean shutdown
//!   can reset it, so a crash freezes it set. Recover it with
//!   [`crate::File::clear_swmr_flag`] (the `h5clear -s` equivalent).
//!   A crash freezing it set is also what makes it useful beyond SWMR — see
//!   [`WRITE_ACCESS`], which a page-buffered session raises for its lifetime.
//!
//! Both are enforced here: [`acquire_exclusive`] takes the lock, and
//! [`check_status_flags`] refuses an open the on-disk byte says is unsafe
//! (issue #245). The two cover different windows — the lock catches a live
//! writer in this or another process, the flag catches one that is live *or*
//! crashed, including a SWMR writer that holds no lock at all.
//!
//! ## Lock scope: the in-place editor only
//!
//! Only [`crate::File::open_rw`] (and the [`crate::File::clear_swmr_flag`]
//! recovery rewrite) take a lock — an **exclusive** one — so a second editor or
//! a concurrent writer cannot open the file. [`crate::File::open_swmr_writer`] and the
//! readers ([`crate::File::open`] and friends) take **no** lock, on purpose:
//!
//! - SWMR is single-writer-*by-contract* and is designed for concurrent reads;
//!   the reference library itself runs SWMR with file locking disabled. Holding
//!   a lock would defeat the "multiple-reader" half.
//! - Crucially, [`std::fs::File`] locking is **advisory on Unix** (`flock`) but
//!   **mandatory on Windows** (`LockFileEx`): a held lock there blocks *reads* by
//!   every other handle, not just other lock attempts. A whole-file lock on a
//!   SWMR writer would therefore make the file unreadable to its readers on
//!   Windows. Confining locking to the exclusive editor keeps reads working on
//!   every platform. (One consequence: while an editor holds the lock, a
//!   concurrent read of the same file is permitted on Unix but blocked by the OS
//!   on Windows — drop the editor before reading the file back.)
//!
//! Locking uses the cross-platform [`std::fs::File`] lock API, so it adds no
//! dependency, and it lives only in the already `std`-gated edit path, so
//! `no_std`/`wasm` builds are unaffected.

///   snapshot with no protocol for a writer mutating the file underneath it. To
///   follow a live SWMR writer, use [`crate::File::open_swmr`]. The one way past
///   it is [`WriteMarkPolicy::AllowSnapshot`], which the intent carries: it
///   admits a read of [`WRITE_ACCESS`] *alone* — the mark a page-buffered
///   session leaves, which no SWMR reader can follow (issue #419) — on the
///   caller's assertion that the writer has flushed. It does not admit a SWMR
///   pair, which has a reader of its own.
/// - [`SwmrRead`](OpenIntent::SwmrRead) refuses only a *mismatched* pair — one
///   bit without the other. Both bits is exactly the live SWMR writer it exists
///   to follow, and neither is a quiescent file.
///
/// ## Why only a version-3 superblock
///
/// The check is gated to superblock version 3 and up because that is where the
/// C library gates it, and a divergence in either direction is a real cost: the
/// C library raises the write bit on a version-0/1/2 file too and never reads
/// it back, so checking those versions would refuse files `H5Fopen` accepts —

/// buffer behind a mark no reader would honor — so no flag this crate raises
/// falls outside the gate.
